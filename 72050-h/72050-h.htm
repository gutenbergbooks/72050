<div class="sidenote"><i>LOYAL AND DISLOYAL PRINTERS.</i></div>

<p class="drop-img unindent"><span class="drop-img"><img alt="a" src="images/drop_a.jpg" width="75"></span>
<span class="smcap">singular</span> illustration of the still partially
troubled times which followed is furnished
by a proceeding of Samuel Negus, printer.
In 1724 he published a list of all the
printers then exercising their craft in London, and he
most humbly laid it before Lord Viscount Townshend;
no doubt, for his guidance. The list is divided into
four parts. The first consists of those ‘known to be
well affected to King George.’ There are thirty-four
of these ultra-loyal fellows, with Negus, of course,
among them. The second list is headed ‘Nonjurors;’
in this, three names are entered, one of which is
‘Bowyer.’ In the third list, headed, ‘said to be High
Flyers,’ there are two and thirty names; among them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
are found Alderman Barber (the friend of Swift, of
Bolingbroke and Pope), Richardson (the novelist), and
Mist (the Jacobite and something more!). The fourth
list consists of three names, ‘Roman Catholics.’ Negus
was probably a malicious though loyal busy-body.
His list harmed neither Nonjuror nor High Flyer.
When, in 1729, Mr. Speaker Onslow was instrumental
in procuring for Bowyer the printing of the votes of
the House of Commons, an alarmed and loyal Whig
asked Mr. Speaker if he was aware that he was employing
a Nonjuror. ‘I am quite sure of this,’ said
Onslow, ‘I am employing a truly honest man.’ There
was no lack of them among Nonjurors, and it is pleasant
to find that even the High Flyers came soon to be
looked upon by reasonable Whigs as honourable men.
In 1732 Alderman Barber was elected by his fellow
citizens Lord Mayor of London; and he was the first
printer who enjoyed that dignity. This is the more
remarkable, as poor Mrs. Manley, mistress of the
alderman’s house and of the alderman, had bitterly
satirised the Whig Ministry in her ‘New Atalantis.’
But the lady was now dead, and the High-Flying Barber
lost nothing by his old Jacobite opinions.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>SACHEVEREL.</i></div>

<p>In the year 1724, the Nonjurors lost one who had
been their foremost man till he took the oath of allegiance;
namely Sacheverel. That act of homage to
Brunswick was never forgotten or forgiven by the Jacobites.
When Sacheverel died in the spring of 1724,
Hearne could only acknowledge his boldness and good
presence. ‘He delivered a thing better than a much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
more modest man, however preferable in learning, could
do.’ Hearne sarcastically calls Sacheverel a ‘but,’ and
says the best thing this <em>but</em> ever printed was the speech
at his trial, ‘which was none of his own, but was penned
by Dr. Francis Atterbury.’ Hearne’s hardest hit at this
recreant parson is to be found in the following words:
‘He was but an indifferent scholar, but pretended to a
great deal of honesty, which I could never see in him,
since he was the forwardest to take the oaths, notwithstanding
he would formerly be so forward in speaking
for, and drinking the health of, King James <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>HIS DEATH.</i></div>

<p>The once famous and audacious Nonjuror, the friend
of Addison when both were young together, lost caste
with the Jacobites without gaining the esteem of the
Whigs. Mist’s High-Flying ‘Weekly Journal,’ of which
Sacheverel was once the Magnus Apollo, recorded his
death and burial with no more ceremony than if he
had been an ordinary alderman of no particular political
colour. Perhaps this great reserve showed that
sureties binding Mist to keep the peace were not mere
formalities. Not so with Read and his Whig ‘Weekly.’
On Saturday, June 20, Sacheverel received therein
this charitable notice: ‘Yesterday night was buried,
at St. Andrew’s, Holborn, Dr. Henry Sacheverel, whose
virtues are too notorious to be enlarged upon. One
of his most conspicuous excellences for many years
last past was that he got his living in the high road to—which
though through great Mercy he escaped <em>here</em>,
yet some people are so very censorious as to judge,—but
this we look upon to be barbarous and unchristian,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
and we say we <em>hope the best</em>, and yet we heartily wish
our Hopes were a little better grounded. However,
as there is a good old saying, <i lang="la">De mortuis nil nisi bonum</i>,
<i>i.e.</i> “If you speak of the dead, speak in their praise,”
and not being able, upon the strictest enquiry, to find
the least commendable circumstance relating to the Deceased,
from his cradle to his coffin, we choose rather
to be silent than uncivil.’</p>

<p>The doctor seemed to recall his oath of allegiance,
when he made a bequest in his will of 500<abbr title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr> to Atterbury.
It was an approval, as far as the sum went, of the efforts
of the ex-prelate to dethrone George <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>, and to bring
in a Popish sovereign, who was not at all reluctant to
promise especial favours to the Church of England!
That Atterbury was watching events in London is now
known, from his correspondence. In one of his letters
from Paris to the Chevalier or ‘King,’ he refers with
vexation to the conciliatory course the Government in
London was adopting towards the Jacobites: ‘They
are beginning,’ he says, ‘with Alderman Barber on this
head, and have actually offered him his pardon here
for 3,000<abbr title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr>, which it shall not be my fault, if he accepts.’
The ex-Jacobite alderman ‘went over,’ in spite of the
Jacobite ex-bishop.</p>

<p>The 30th of January sermons (1725) before the
Lords, in the Abbey, and the Commons, in St. Margaret’s,
had now almost ceased to be political. The former was
preached by Waugh, Bishop of Carlisle, from the Book
of Chronicles; the latter, by the Rev. Dr. Lupton, from
1 Samuel xii. 25, a text which had been much preached<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
on by expounders on both sides: ‘If ye shall still do
wickedly, ye shall be consumed, both ye and your
king.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A NEW TOAST.</i></div>

<p>Against the king in possession, the Jacobites now
and then flung pointless darts. Mist’s Journal uttered
sarcasms against the Westminster mounted Train Bands,
complimenting the most of them for not tumbling out
of their saddles. The same semi-rebel paper recorded
with satisfaction, as a sign of the Duke of Wharton’s
principles, that if the little stranger ‘expected by the
Duchess, proved to be a boy, his name should be
James; if a girl, Clementina;’ or, in other words,
the child was to be called after the King or Queen of
England, <i lang="la">de jure</i>. Not long after, the bold and roystering
London Jacobites were rapturously drinking a
health, which was given by one guest in the form of
‘Henry,’ to which another added, ‘Benedict,’ a third
named ‘Maria,’ and a fourth raised his glass to ‘Clement.’
In this form, they greeted the birth of the
second son of the Chevalier de St. George. Some
ventured to (prematurely) speak of him as Duke of
York. The Whigs looked upon this birth with more
or less indifference; and their papers contain no unseemly
jests on the occasion.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>BOLINGBROKE.</i></div>

<p>But the especial attention of Londoners was drawn
to more important matters. Whigs and Jacobites
looked with equal interest to the attempt made by
Bolingbroke’s friends to enable him to succeed to his
father’s estates, notwithstanding the Act of Attainder
to the contrary. Leave to bring in a Bill, with this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
object, was asked by Lord Finch, in the Commons, on
April 20th, with the sanction of king and Government,
whom Bolingbroke had petitioned to that effect. Lord
Finch explained that the petitioner had been pardoned
by his Majesty, for past treason, but that even a royal
pardon could not ride over an Act of Attainder, to
the extent asked, without an Act of Parliament. The
petitioner had fully acknowledged his former great
guilt, and had made promises, on which his Majesty
confidently relied, of inviolable fidelity for the future.
Walpole gave great significance to the words uttered in
support by saying, ‘He has sufficiently atoned for all
past offences,’ Then Mr. Methuen, of Corsham, Wilts,
sprang to his feet to oppose the motion and denounce
the traitor. He did both in the most violent and unmeasured
terms. He lost no point that could tell against
Bolingbroke, from the earliest moment of his political
career,—ever hostile to true English interests,—down
to that of the asking leave to absolve the traitor from
the too mild penalties with which his treason had been
visited. No expiation could atone for his crimes; and
no trust could be placed in his promises.
<span class="sni"><i>BOLINGBROKE’S ADVERSARIES.</i></span>
One after
the other, Lord William Paulet, Arthur Onslow,
Sir Thomas Pengelly and Gybbon smote Bolingbroke
with phrases that bruised his reputation like blows on
mail from battle-axes. They were all, however, surpassed
in fierceness and argument by Serjeant Miller,
who branded Bolingbroke as a traitor to the king,
country, and Government; a villain who, if favoured
as he now asked to be, would betray again those whom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
he had betrayed before, if he found advantage in doing
so. Serjeant Miller said that he loved the king,
country, and ministry more than he loved himself, and
that he hated their enemies more than they did. To
loosen the restraints on Bolingbroke was only to facilitate
his evil action, and so forth; but Jacobite Dr.
Freind, who had tasted of the Tower, extolled the
royal clemency to Bolingbroke; and the assurance of
Walpole that the traitor had rendered services which
expiated all by-gone treason, weighed with the House,
and the condoning Bill was ultimately passed, by 231
to 113.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>IN THE LORDS HOUSE.</i></div>

<p>Public interest in London was only diverted for a
moment from this measure, by the debate in the House
of Lords, in May, on another Bill (from the Commons)
for disarming the Highlanders in Scotland, which ended
in the Bill being carried. Five peers signed a protest
against it, partly on the ground that England now
enjoyed ‘that invaluable blessing—a perfect calm and
tranquility;’ that the Highlanders now manifested no
spirit of disorder, and that it became all good patriots
‘to endeavour rather to keep them quiet than
to make them so.’ The comment in all the Whig
circles of London, as they heard of the protest, was
to repeat the names of those who subscribed it,—Wharton,
Scarsdale, Lichfield, Gower, and Orrery.
Of them, the first was almost openly in the Chevalier’s
service, and the other four were thorough Jacobites.
But the interest in this Bill was as nothing compared
with that renewed by the Bill (sent up by the Commons)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
which passed the House of Lords on May 24th,
1725, by 75 to 25, for restoring Bolingbroke to his
estates. The protest against the Act was signed by
the Earls of Coventry and Bristol, Lords Clinton,
Onslow, and Lechmere. The articles of the protest
are among the most explicit and interesting ever issued
from Westminster, and are to this <span class="lock">effect:—</span></p>

<p>The lands and other property of ‘the late Viscount
Bolingbroke’ had been forfeited through his treason,
and had been appropriated to public uses; therefore,
say the protesters, it would be ‘unjust to all the
subjects of this kingdom, who have borne many heavy
taxes, occasioned, as we believe, in great measure by
the treasons committed, and the rebellion which was
encouraged by this person, to take from the public the
benefit of his forfeiture.’</p>

<p>The treasons he committed were of ‘the most
flagrant and dangerous nature’; they were ‘fully confessed
by his flight from the justice of Parliament,’
and they were indisputably demonstrated by his new
treasons when he ‘entered publicly into the counsels
and services of the Pretender, who was then fomenting
and carrying on a rebellion within these kingdoms
for the dethroning his Majesty, into which Rebellion
many subjects of his Majesty, Peers and Commoners,
were drawn, as we believe, by the example or influence
of the late Lord Bolingbroke, and for which
reason many Peers and Commoners have since been
attainted and some of them executed, and their estates
become forfeited by their attainder.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>DENUNCIATIONS AGAINST HIM.</i></div>

<p>What services Bolingbroke had rendered to King
George, since he was a convicted traitor, were not
publicly known, but might justly be suspected. He
had never expressed the slightest sorrow for his treason;
and there was no security that he might not
again betray the king and country, for no trust could
be placed in his most solemn assurances. Supposing
recent services justified reward, it was not such reward
as could not be recalled. Persons who had rendered
similar services had been rendered dependent on the
Government for the continuance of those rewards, and
so it should be, they thought, with Bolingbroke. The
five peers further remarked that no pardon under the
Great Seal could be pleadable to an impeachment by
the Commons, and that Bolingbroke had, in fact, no
right or title to the benefits conferred upon him by a
Bill which restored him to his estates, in spite of the
Act of the Attainder.</p>

<p>The public discussed these matters with interest,
and (except a few Jacobites) thought nothing of plots
and pretenders. Atterbury, however, was as pertinaciously
working as ever, to see his royal master James
crowned at Westminster. In one of the numerous
letters written by him this year, Atterbury suggests
that James shall express his hopes to the Duke of
Bourbon, then at the head of the French Government,
that if the juncture at present will not suffer the Duke
to do anything directly for him, yet at least that he
will not so far act against him as to endeavour to draw
off others from their designs and determinations to
serve him—the King, James <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>AN EPIGRAM.</i></div>

<p>Among the ex-bishop’s friends in London was the
Rev. Samuel Wesley, brother of John. The Tory
journal ‘Mist’ had said of him that Mr. Wesley had
refused to write against Pope, on the ground that ‘his
best patron’ had a friendship for the poet. Thence
arose the question, ‘Who <em>was</em> his best patron?’—a
question which was answered by an epigrammatist (by
some said to be Pope himself), who suggested that the
patron was either the exiled Jacobite Bishop Atterbury,
or the Earl of Oxford.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">Wesley, if Wesley ’tis they mean,</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>FRESH INTRIGUES.</i></div>

<p>The king’s speech, on opening Parliament in
January, 1726, rather alarmed London (which was
not dreaming of the recurrence of evil times), by assurances
that in the City and in foreign Courts intrigues
were then being carried on for the restoration of the
Pretender. Additions to the armed force of the realm
were suggested as advisable. A suspicion arose that
in this suggestion the defence of Hanover from foreign
aggression was more thought of than that of England<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
against the Chevalier. However, the Lords dutifully
<span class="lock">replied:—</span></p>

<p>‘We can easily believe that at such a juncture, new
schemes and solicitations are daily making by the most
profligate and abandoned of them (the enemies of the
King and Government), to revive the expiring cause of
the Pretender; all which, we assure ourselves, can
have no other effect than to hasten his destruction and
the utter ruin of all his perjured adherents.’</p>

<p>The majority in the Commons, not a whit less loyal,
used similar terms, adding, with reference to traitors
near St. James’s: ‘The disaffected and discontented
here have not been less industrious by false rumours
and suggestions to fill the minds of the people with
groundless fears and alarms, in order to affect the
public credit, and, by distressing the government, give
encouragement to the enemies of our peace.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>POLITICAL WRITERS.</i></div>

<p>Two notable persons who had, in their several
ways, filled people’s minds with groundless alarms, now
departed from the stage. On the 5th of February died
the two great antagonistic news-writers of this Jacobite
time, Abel Roper and George Ridpath. The former
was proprietor of the Tory ‘Post Boy,’ the latter of
the Hanoverian ‘Flying Post.’ Pope has pilloried both
in the ‘Dunciad,’ and pelted them in an uncomplimentary
note. The Whig ‘Weekly Journal’ says of
Abel, that in the ‘Post Boy’ ‘he has left such abundant
testimony for his zeal for indefeasible hereditary right,
for monarchy, passive obedience, the Church, the
Queen (Anne), and the Doctor (Sacheverel), that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
public can be no strangers to his principles either in
Church or State.’ Ridpath, Ropers celebrated antagonist,
had been obliged in 1711 to fly to Holland, to
escape the consequences of too severely criticising
Queen Anne’s Ministry. In exile, he wrote ‘Parliamentary
Right Maintained, or the Hanover Succession
Justified.’ This was by way of a confuting reply to
the ultra-Jacobite work of Dr. Bedford, ‘Hereditary
Right to the Crown of England Asserted.’ Ridpath,
having rendered such good service to the Hanoverian
succession, appeared in London, as soon as George <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>,
himself. He got his reward in an appointment to be
one of the Patentees for serving the Commissioners of
the Customs, &amp;c., in Scotland, with stationery wares!</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>WHARTON, BOASTING.</i></div>

<p>Ridpath was a sort of public intelligencer for the
Government. It is certain, on the other hand, that not
only was the Government in London well served by its
own private ‘Intelligencers,’ but it was equally well supplied
through the folly of Jacobites at foreign Courts.
From the British Envoys at those Courts dispatches
reached London, which must have often made the
Cockpit, where the Cabinet Ministers met, joyous with
laughter. For example, towards the end of April, Mr.
Robinson was reading a dispatch from Mr. Keen at
Madrid, in which the latter described the Duke of Wharton,
then a fugitive, as ever drinking and smoking; and
such a talker in his cups as to betray himself, his party,
and their designs. Keen encouraged his visits, accordingly.
‘The evening he was with me he declared himself
the Pretender’s Prime Minister and Duke of Wharton and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
Northumberland. “Hitherto,” says he, “my master’s
interest has been managed by the Duchess of Perth
and three or four other old women who meet under the
portal of St. Germain. He wanted a Whig and a
brick van to put them in the right train, and I am the
man. You may now look upon me, Sir Philip Wharton,
Knight of the Garter, and Sir Robert Walpole, Knight
of the Bath, running a course, and by God, he shall
be hard pressed. He bought my family pictures, but
they will not be long in his possession; that account
is still open. Neither he nor King George shall be six
months at ease, as long as I have the honour to serve
in the employ I am in.”’ Wharton was telling the
Duke of Ormond that his master did not love foxhunting,
but that he promised to go to Newmarket.
To which Ormond answered, ‘he saw no great probability
of it on a sudden, but wished the Pretender
might take such care of his affairs that he might be able
to keep his word.’</p>

<p>Besides a promise to go to Newmarket, there was
shadowed forth another promise this year, which was,
or was not, performed some years later—namely, the
adhesion of the young Chevalier to the Church of
England. Probably from some follower of the exiled
family was derived the information, which was put into
London newspaper shape in the following fashion, in
the month of <span class="lock">July:—</span></p>

<p>‘The Chevalier de St. George is at his last shifts,
for now his eldest son is to be brought up in the principles
of the Church of England. To give a proof of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
which he was led by a Church at Rome, by his
Governor, who did not stop to let him kneel at the
singing of the Ave Maria.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>PRINCE WILLIAM, DUKE OF CUMBERLAND.</i></div>

<p>This announcement was made, probably, to keep
warm the interest of the Protestant Jacobites in the
Stuart family generally, and in the person, particularly,
of young Charles Edward, of whose equivocal Church-of-Englandism
this is the equally equivocal foreshadowing.
In the same month, little Prince William was
created Duke of Cumberland. The future victor at
Culloden was then five years old. The papers had at
an earlier period recorded how he had cut his teeth,
and they now noticed his military tendencies; but none
could have conjectured how these were to be applied
subsequently, at Fontenoy, and on the field near
Inverness.</p>

<p>A simple act on the part of his father, the Prince of
Wales, awoke the Whig muse to sing his praise. During
the absence of the king in Hanover, a fire broke out in
Spring Gardens. The Prince went down to it, not as
an idle spectator in the way of the firemen, but as an
active helper. This help was so effectively given as
to induce a Whig poet to put the popular feeling in
<span class="lock">rhyme:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy guardian, blest Britannia, scorns to sleep,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When the sad subjects of his father weep.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Weak Princes, by their fears, increase distress,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><em>He</em> faces danger, and so makes it less.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tyrants, on blazing towers may smile with joy:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><em>He</em> knows to <em>save</em> is greater than <em>destroy</em>!</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>IN KENSINGTON GARDENS.</i></div>

<p>When the king was this year in town, he risked his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
popularity among the Whig mobile, by adding a considerable
portion of Hyde Park to the pretty but confined
grounds—Kensington Gardens. There was an outcry,
but grumblers were informed that they should rather
rejoice, seeing that the whole would be laid out ‘after
the fashion of the Elector of Hanover’s famous gardens
at Herrenhausen.’ The Jacobites wished the Elector
had never quitted that ancestral home of beauty. The
present generation may be congratulated that the King
of England created such another home of beauty here.
It was, indeed, for himself and family: the public were
not thought of. A few peers and peeresses, with
other great personages, were allowed to have keys, in
the absence of the royal family; but, at the present
time, the gardens have become the inheritance of the
nation; and the national heir may be proud of such a
possession.</p>

<p>It was there, in the autumn of the year, that two
pleasant acts of grace occurred. The Earl of Seaforth,
attainted for his share in the rebellion of 1715, was
there, by arrangement, presented to the king. The
Jacobite peer went on his knees and confessed his
treason. The king granted him his pardon, and gave
him his hand to kiss; but the great Scottish earldom
has never been restored to the noble house of Mackenzie.
A similar scene took place when Sir Hugh
Paterson, of Bannockburn, received the royal pardon.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>SEAFORTH’S PARDON.</i></div>

<p>Nevertheless, who was serving or betraying King
George at the Chevalier’s Court, or King James in
London, is, among other official secrets, locked up in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
State papers. One illustration of the state of affairs in
London was afforded, unpleasantly, to Atterbury, by
the pardon of Lord Seaforth. That Jacobite peer had
been made a Marquis by James <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>, and wished to be
further made a Duke. At the same time Seaforth was
negotiating with the British Government for his pardon
and a grant out of his forfeited estate. Both were
accorded, and the ex-Jacobite became a courtier at St.
James’s. Mr. F. Williams, the apologist of Atterbury,
says, that such Jacobites caused endless anxiety to the
ex-bishop, and that their heart was not in the cause:
all they had nearest at heart was their own pride,
selfishness, and vanity!</p>

<p>The above acts of grace increased the general goodwill
which was entertained towards the royal family.
The Prince of Wales showed especial tact in obtaining
popular suffrage. When the water-pageant of the Lord
Mayor, Sir John Eyles, Bart., passed along the river,
the Prince and Princess of Wales, with the little Duke
of Cumberland, stood in the river-side gardens of old
Somerset House, to see the procession pass. It was
not pre-arranged; but when the family group was seen,
the state barges pulled in towards the garden-terrace,
and there the chief magistrate offered wine to the
prince who, taking it, drank to ‘The Prosperity of the
City of London.’ Colonel Exelbe, Chief Bailiff of the
Weavers, brought up the company’s state barge, as the
others were pulling out to the middle stream, and, say
the daily chroniclers, ‘in a manly, hearty voice, drank
to the health of the Prince, the Princess, and the little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
Duke.’ The prince delighted the weavers by drinking
to them ‘out of the same bottle.’</p>

<p>The autumn brought pleasant news to London,
namely, that the disarmament of the Highlands had
been successfully accomplished by General Wade. This
brings, in connection with London, a well-known personage
on the stage.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ROBERT MACGREGOR CAMPBELL.</i></div>

<p>Robert Macgregor, having been compelled to drop
the prohited surname, had taken that of Campbell, but
he was familiarly known as Rob Roy. He was in arms
against King George at Sheriff Muir, but he betrayed
the Jacobite cause by refusing, at a critical moment, to
charge and win a victory for King James. Romance
has thrown a halo round this most contemptible rascal.
He wrote to Wade, when the disarmament was going
on: ‘I was forced to take part with the adherents of
the Pretender; for, the country being all in arms, it
was neither safe nor indeed possible for me to stand
neuter. I should not, however, plead my being forced
into this unnatural Rebellion against his Majesty, King
George, if I could not at the same time assure your
Excellency, that I not only avoided acting offensively
against his Majesty’s forces, on all occasions, but, on the
contrary, sent his Grace the Duke of Argyle all the intelligence
I could, from time to time, of the strength
and situation of the rebels, which I hope his Grace will
do me the justice to acknowledge.... Had it been in
my power as it was in my inclination, I should always
have acted for the service of his Majesty King George;
and the one reason of my begging the favour of your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
intercession with his Majesty, for the pardon of my life,
is the earnest desire I have to employ it in his service,
whose goodness, justice, and humanity are so conspicuous
to all mankind.’ This precious letter, signed
Robert Campbell, is quoted by Scott (Introduction to
‘Rob Roy,’ edit. 1831), from an authentic narrative,
by George Chalmers, of Wade’s proceedings in the
Highlands, which narrative is incorporated into the
Appendix to Burt’s ‘Letters from the North of Scotland.’
<span class="sni"><i>ROB ROY’S LETTER TO WADE.</i></span>
Scott remarks on the letter from Rob Roy to
Marshal Wade: ‘What influence his plea had on
General Wade we have no means of knowing....
Rob Roy appears to have lived very much as usual.’
The London newspapers show, on the contrary, that
the usual tenour of this thief and traitor’s life was very
seriously interrupted. Of the disaffected chiefs of clans
who had been ‘out and active’ on the Jacobite side in
1715, a good number at the time of the disarmament
were seized and brought to London, with intimation
that their lives would be spared. What became of
them is told in the ‘Weekly Journal’ for January
24th, 1727, namely, that ‘His Majesty, with his usual
clemency, had pardoned the following Jacobites who
had been convicted capitally of high treason in the first
year of his reign, for levying war against him.’ The
pardoned traitors were: ‘Robert Stuart of Appin, Alexander
Macdonald of Glencoe, Grant of Glenmorrison,
Machinnin of that Ilk, Mackenzie of Fairburn, Mackenzie
of Dachmalnack, Chisholm of Strathglass, Mackenzie
of Ballumukie, MacDougal of Lorne,’ and two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
others, more notable than all the rest, ‘James, commonly
called Lord, Ogilvie,’ and ‘Robert Campbell,
<i lang="la">alias</i> MacGregor, commonly called Rob Roy.’
<span class="sni"><i>ROB ROY IN NEWGATE.</i></span>
They
had been under durance in London, for it is added
that ‘on Tuesday last, they were carried from Newgate
to Gravesend, to be put on shipboard for transportation
to Barbadoes,’ Rob Roy marching handcuffed to Lord
Ogilvie through the London streets, from Newgate to
the prison barge at Blackfriars, and thence to Gravesend
is an incident that escaped the notice of Walter Scott
and of all Rob’s biographers. The barge load of Highland
chiefs and of some thieves seems, however, to have
been pardoned, and allowed to return home.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>The Highland ‘Bobadil,’ MacGregor, is said to have
appeared publicly in London, both in street and park,
and that, as he was walking in front of St. James’s Palace,
the Duke of Argyle pointed him out to George <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>, or
according to another version, George <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>; and that
at the sight, the king declared, he had never seen a
handsomer man in the Highland garb. This was probably
one of the floating stories of the time, lacking
foundation, save that a plaided Scotsman may have
been seen near the palace; thence came the story.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
<span class="sni"><i>ROB ROY IN LONDON.</i></span>
With a fictitious story of Rob’s exploits, the Londoners,
however, were familiar. This appeared in a history
called the ‘The Highland Rogue.’ Scott describes it
as ‘a catchpenny publication. In this book, Rob is
said to be a species of ogre with a beard of a foot in
length; and his actions are as much exaggerated as
his personal appearance.’ It seems to have been made
up of details in which there was much inaccuracy and
still more invention. Seven years after the release
from Newgate, Rob Roy died at Innerlochlarig-beg,
on the 28th of December, 1734. He was buried in
Balquhidder churchyard, half a dozen miles from
where he died, and he was, at the time of his death,
sixty-three years and some odd months old.</p>

<p>An honest man, one who served his country well,
but who has not been celebrated in romance like Rob
Roy, was missed from the Southwark side of the
Thames, where his figure had been daily familiar for a
long period to the inhabitants, namely, Sir Rowland
Gwyn. On the last Monday in January, this venerable
baronet died. The ultramontane Jacobites had little
respect for him. When Sir Rowland was M.P. for
Radnor, in King William’s reign, he brought in the
Bill for settling the Protestant Succession in the House
of Hanover. For some time Sir Rowland was our
‘Resident’ in Hanover; but he displeased Queen
Anne’s Ministry, withdrew to Hamburg, and did not
return to England till the accession of George <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>
After figuring in London for a time, hard circumstances
drove him to live in the Liberties of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
King’s Bench, and there, after having been familiarly
known to, and diversely treated by, both Whigs and
Tories, the old ultra-Protestant Baronet died, somewhat
miserably.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A NOTE OF ALARM.</i></div>

<p>The king blew a loud note of alarm, with regard
to the Chevalier, on the last occasion of the opening
Parliament during his reign. Lord Chancellor King
read the royal speech, in which the announcement was
made that the Emperor and the King of Spain had
entered into an offensive alliance, the object of which
was to place the Pretender on the British throne and to
destroy the established religion and government. The
Emperor’s representative in London, Von Palm, made
a bold comment on this speech. It was conveyed in a
Latin letter to his British Majesty, in which the writer
impertinently stated that there were many assertions
in the speech which were misstatements, meant
truthfully, perhaps, but much strained to make them
wear a truthful appearance. Other assertions were (if
well meant) based on erroneous grounds; but the
declaration that the Emperor had joined, secretly or
openly, with the King of Spain to effect the restoration
of the Stuarts, was denounced by Von Palm as an
unmitigated falsehood. For this audacity, the Imperial
representative was ordered to leave the kingdom. The
envoy’s great offence had been made greater by the
publication of the Imperial Memorial (translated) in
London, by the Emperor’s order. This appeal to the
nation against the sovereign manifested a vulgar impudence
on the part of his sacred, imperial, and catholic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
Majesty which thoroughly disgusted the people of these
kingdoms.
<span class="sni"><i>PATRIOTIC JACOBITES.</i></span>
To the great honour of the Jacobites in
Parliament, they exhibited a true English spirit. They
became, in fact, for the first time, ‘his Majesty’s Opposition.’
Shippen and Wyndham, especially, in Parliament,
supported by their political colleagues, branded
this ignoble attempt to put dissension between king
and people as one which touched the honour of the
nation, and which the nation would resent, to sustain
the honour of its king. If this display of spirit led
some to believe that Jacobitism, as a Stuart sentiment,
was dead, the belief was erroneous. Soon after Palm
was compelled to leave the kingdom, an outrage was
committed on the recently erected double-gilt equestrian
statue of George <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>, in Grosvenor Square. The
statue, which was ‘by Nost,’ according to the papers,
Van Ost was pulled down, horse and rider. The
kings sword was broken, his truncheon beaten out of
his hands, his legs and arms hammered off, and a significant
hacking at his neck was a token of beheading him
in effigy. A gross libel was stuck to the pedestal; and
that unoccupied pedestal still remains as a monument
of the Jacobite virulence of the time. A reward of
100<abbr title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr> was offered in vain for the discovery of the
perpetrators.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>VOLTAIRE.</i></div>

<p>At this moment there was a Frenchman in London
who was sufficiently distinguished, even then, to have
his name turned to account in a partisan political
paragraph,—Voltaire. The Jacobites were probably
not aware of Voltaire’s approval of the martyrdom of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
their king and saint, Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> ‘On the 30th of
January,’ said Voltaire, ‘every King wakes with a
crick in the neck.’ On January 28th, the ‘British
Journal’ had the following well-turned paragraph:
‘Last week, M. Voltaire, the famous French poet, who
was banished from France, was introduced to his
Majesty who received him very graciously. They say
he has received notice from France not to print his
Poem of the League, “La Henriade,” a Prosecution still
depending against him, by the Cardinal de Bissy, on the
Account of the Praises bestowed in that Book on Queen
Elizabeth’s behaviour in Matters of Religion, and a
great many Strokes against the Abuse of Popery, and
against Persecution in Matter of Faith.’ This allusion
to religious liberty had, unconsciously, a startling comment.
While Voltaire was kissing the royal hand, a
soldier was being ‘whipt’ in the Park, for being a
Papist! He was neither the first nor the last who
suffered for no worse cause. At the same moment, the
ultramontane authorities in France were hanging men
for belonging to the reformed religion! What an
excellent thing it is for Christian brethren to live
together in love and unity!</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE NEW REIGN.</i></div>

<p>On the 3rd of June, the royal and imperial courts
having become reconciled, and peace seeming established
among nations, the king set out for Hanover. That day
week he was lying dead on a sofa at Osnaburg. A
heavy supper and much cold melon, the night before, had
done the work which, as some thought, might prove
a Jacobite opportunity. It proved otherwise. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
paragraph of a few lines in the newspapers, unencumbered
by any mourning border, told the people that a
new reign had begun. The old king was soon forgotten.
The younger one and his queen, Caroline,
mourned officially, but they inaugurated their own
accession, joyously. It may be added, ‘wisely,’ too.
Their water-pageants made the then silver Thames glad
and glorious. They went afloat in state, followed by
gay Court barges full of high-born ladies and gallant
gentlemen. The royal musicians in another vessel
played the last new opera airs. According to the tide,
these great folk went up the river to Chelsea or down
to Shadwell. They received warm welcome whithersoever
they went; more particularly when the royal
barge pulled in near the shore, and the pleased occupants
graciously took the flowers offered to them by
good people, who might be hanged before the month
was out, for stealing half of one of the nosegays. On
these occasions, the broad river could hardly be seen
for the compact mass of boats, fearfully laden, that
drifted or were rowed upon it. As in the first George’s
time, these popular pageants continued afloat long after
the moon was up. Often on these occasions, the king
and queen did not land at Whitehall, till after ten had
struck. There, the sedan chairs were in waiting, and
with one individual in each, gentlemen of the chamber
and maids of honour being carried in the rear, and
torchbearers, if need were, flanking the procession, the
whole party were daintily lifted through the park to St.
James’s palace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CORONATION.</i></div>

<p>The coronation was to have taken place on the 4th
of October. It was put off for a week. At this postponement,
people speculated on the possibility of some
Jacobite daring to take up the Champion’s gage. The
Jacobite that was really feared was named Spring Tide.
An invasion of Westminster Hall was both possible and
probable; and thence, the postponement for a week.
On the 11th the ceremony was performed with somewhat
of maimed rites. The queen went in a close sedan
to Westminster, with the Lord Chamberlain and a
Maid of Honour in hack chairs; and they returned in
the same unroyal fashion. There was no interruption
in Abbey or Hall, as timid people anticipated, and at
night all London was drunk, or nearly so, according to
custom.</p>

<p>On the king’s birthday in October, there was a
singular sort of rejoicing in one part of the metropolis.
There were Jacobite and other prisoners in Newgate
who ‘lay there for their fines,’—in fact, could not be
discharged for lack of cash to pay their fees. They
celebrated the day ‘by illuminating the windows of the
gaol with candles;’ they drank the health of their
Majesties who would do nothing to deliver them, the
Judges who had condemned, and the Magistrates who
had previously committed them. They forgave everybody,
and went to bed almost as drunk as their
keepers. It is due to the king however to say that
when he with the queen and royal family dined with
the Mayor and chief citizens in the Guildhall, he left a
thousand pounds for the relief of poor debtors. Some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
‘state prisoners’ in Newgate were also liberated on
their recognizances.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>PRINCE FREDERICK.</i></div>

<p>In December, Frederick, Prince of Wales, in obedience
to his father’s commands, left Hanover suddenly
in the night. He travelled to the coast, and embarked
on board an ordinary packet-boat from Holland to
Harwich. Thence, he went on his way posting to
Whitechapel; there he hired a hackney-coach, drove
to St. James’s, and walked by the back stairs to the
queen’s room, where he was decently welcomed,
though the greeting was neither affectionate nor enthusiastic.</p>

<p>Outwardly, there was an appearance of tranquility;
but there was still an uneasiness in the Ministry, which
seems to have led to the establishment of a spy system
in private society. In the Atterbury correspondence of
this year, there is a letter (written in December) from
the Duchess of Buckingham to Mrs. Morrice, in which
that illegitimate daughter of James <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> says:—‘I have
nothing passes in my family I would give three farthings
to hide, yet I am sure the gossiping women and such
kind of men send and invite my son to dinner and
supper, to pick something from him of what passes in
conversation either from me or my company.’</p>

<p>Walpole, however, had never experienced any
difficulty in getting any information he required from
the Jacobite duchess, whom he duped and flattered.</p>

<p class="p2 footnote"><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> Lord Ogilvie, son of the Earl of Airlie, did not assume the title
borne by his father, when the latter died in 1717; but when Lord
Ogilvie died childless, in 1731, his next brother, John, took the title of
Earl. This John’s son, David, Lord Ogilvie, not profiting by experience,
fell under attainder for acting with the Jacobites in arms, in 1745; but
he too was ultimately pardoned by George <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> The hereditary honours,
however, were not confirmed by Act of Parliament till 1826, when
David, who had called himself Earl of Airlie, could thenceforth do so
without question.</p>

<span class="smcap">he</span> Court of George <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> opened the new year
with a reckless gaiety that reminds one of
Whitehall in the time of Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>, as
described by Evelyn. Twelfth Night was
especially dissipated in its character. There was a
ball at St. James’s, and there were numerous gaming
tables for those who did not dance. The king and
queen lost 500 guineas at Ombre; the Earl of Sunderland,
more than twice as much. General Wade lost 800
guineas, and Lord Finch half that sum. The winners were
Lord William Manners, of 1,200 guineas; the Duchess
of Dorset, of 900 guineas; the Earl of Chesterfield,
of 550 guineas. The play was frantically pursued,
and a madder scene could not have been exhibited by
the Stuarts themselves.
<span class="sni"><i>MIST’S JOURNAL.</i></span>
Mist’s Jacobite Journal referred
sarcastically to the brilliant dissipation. On the
wit and repartee which duly distinguished a royal
masquerade at the opera-house, Mist made a remark by
which he contrived to hit the Parliament. ‘They may
be looked upon,’ he said, ‘as a Prologue to the Top
Parts that are expected to be soon acted in another
place.’ The death of an honest Scotch baronet, named<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
Wallace, gave Mist another opportunity which he did
not let slip. ‘Sir Thomas’ was declared to be ‘a
lineal descendant of the famous Sir William Wallace
of Eldersly, called the Restorer of the Liberties of
Scotland, in whose days our distressed country wanted
not a worthy patriot to assert her rights.’ On the
anniversary of Queen Anne’s birthday, Mist eulogised
her as ‘that great and good Queen,’ praised the lovers
of Justice, Religion, and Liberty who kept the day;
and added that she was the zealous defender of all
three, ‘and therefore dear to the memory of all such
whose hearts are <em>entirely English</em>.’ For less than this,
men had stood in the pillory. Edmund Curll, the
publisher, was standing there at this very time for
nothing worse than publishing a ‘Memoir of John
Ker of Kersland.’ The times and the manners thereof
were, the first, miserable; the second, horrible.
Robbery and murder were accounted for ‘by the
general poverty and corruption of the times, and the
prevalency of some powerful examples.’ In June, the
‘wasp sting’ takes this form: ‘There is no record of
any robberies this week;—<em>we mean, in the street</em>.’</p>

<p>But for Mist, the general London public would have
been ignorant of the movements of illustrious Jacobites,
abroad. In that paper, they read of the huntings of the
Chevalier de St. George and his boy, Charles Edward.
Lord North and Grey, now a ‘Lieutenant-General in
the army of England,’ and the Duke of Wharton,
Colonel of the Spanish regiment, ‘Hibernia,’ with
other honest gentlemen of the same principles, were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
helping to make Rouen one of the gayest of residences.
At a later period, when Wolfe became the printer of
this Jacobite ‘Weekly,’ and changed its name to ‘Fog’s
Journal,’ <em>canards</em> were plentiful. The Duke of Wharton
is described as having opened a school in Rouen, with
a Newgate bird for an usher; Mist is said to have set
up a hackney coach in the same city; and all three
are congratulated on being able to earn a decent livelihood!</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>LOCKHART OF CARNWATH.</i></div>

<p>A much more honourable Jacobite than any of the
above, was this year pardoned, namely, Lockhart of
Carnwath; but, he was required by the English
Government to pass through London, and present himself
to the king. His return from exile was permitted
only in case of his obedience. On the other hand,
Lockhart stipulated that he should be asked no questions,
and that he should be at full liberty to proceed
home, unmolested. Sir Robert Walpole agreed to
these terms. Lockhart left Rotterdam in May, and
arrived safely in London.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>GEORGE <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> AND LOCKHART.</i></div>

<p>King George seems to have had a curiosity to see
a man who had been plotting to set another in his
place. ‘It was the more remarkable,’ says Lockhart,
‘in that he could not be persuaded or prevailed on to
extend it’ (his gracious disposition) ‘to others, particularly
my Lady Southesk, whose case was more favourable
than mine; and so, to gratify him by my appearing
in his Court, I was obliged to come to London. This
was what did not go well down with me, and what I
would gladly have avoided, but there was no eviting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
it; and as others, whose sincere attachment to the
king’ (James <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>) ‘had often preceded me on such
like occasions, I was under a necessity of bowing my
knee to Baal, now that I was in the house of Rimmon.’</p>

<p>Lockhart was kept waiting more than a fortnight
for the interview. During the whole of that time,
he was ordered to keep himself shut up in his house.
Imagining he was to be put off, he boldly wrote to
Walpole that he might be sent back to Rotterdam.
‘Whereupon, he sent for me next day, and introduced
me to King George in his closet. After a little speech
of thanks, he told me with some heat in his looks that
I had been long in a bad way, and he’d judge, how
far I deserved the favour he had now shown me, by
my future conduct. I made a bow and went off and
determined never to trust to his mercy, which did not
seem to abound.’</p>

<p>Lockhart, however, did trust to King George’s
mercy, and to his honour. He appeared in public, and
was much questioned by Tories in private, or at
dinners and assemblies, as to the affairs of the so-called
James <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> He told them just as much as he
pleased to tell them. They knew too much, he said,
already; but they evidently thought the Jacobite
cause in a better condition than it really was. Lockhart
adds the strange fact that all the members of
the Government received him with great—Sir Robert
Walpole with particularly great—civility. ‘Several
insinuations were made that if I would enter into
the service and measures of the Government I should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
be made very welcome. But I told them that I was
heartily weary of dabbling in politics, and wanted
only to retire and live privately at home.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE JACOBITE CAUSE.</i></div>

<p>Lockhart lingered in London, only to hear how
well-informed the Government had been of his proceedings;
they had read his letters, knew his cyphers,
employed his own agents, and had a spy at the Chevalier’s
side who enjoyed his confidence and betrayed it,
for filthy lucre! Lockhart suspected Inverness, but <em>he</em>
was doubtless not the <em>only</em> agent. The old Jacobite
began to despair of the cause. Above a dozen years
had elapsed since the outbreak of 1715, and while
much had been done, the activity had been employed
on doing nothing. There was now no party, and of
course, no projects. Lockhart’s visit to London, where
he associated with Whigs and Tories, taught him a sad
truth to which he gives melancholy expression. ‘The
old race drops off by degrees, and a new one sprouts
up, that, having no particular bias to the king, as
knowing little more of him than what the public newspapers
bear, enter on the stage with a perfect indifference,
at least coolness, towards him and his cause,
which consequently must daily languish and, in process
of time, be totally forgot. In which melancholy
situation of the king’s affairs. I leave them in the year
1728.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CHARACTER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.</i></div>

<p>George Lockhart admired neither the English people
nor their representatives in the House of Commons.
Both he considered equally ignorant of the nature of
true liberty and the principle of honest government.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
Speaking at one time of the members in Parliament
assembled, he observes,—‘Though all of them are
vested with equal powers, a very few, of the most
active and pragmatical, by persuading the rest that
nothing is done without them, do lead them by the
nose and make mere tools of them, to serve their own
ends. And this, I suppose, is owing to the manner
and way of electing the members; for, being entirely
in the hands of the populace, they, for the most part,
choose those who pay best; so that many are elected
who very seldom attend the House, give themselves no
trouble in business and have no design in being chosen,
even at a great expense, but to have the honour of
being called Parliament men. On the other hand, a
great many are likewise elected who have no concern
for the interest of their country, and, being either poor
or avaricious, aim at nothing but enriching themselves;
and hence it is that no assembly under Heaven produces
so many fools and knaves. The House of
Commons is represented as a wise and august Assembly;
what it was long ago I shall not say, but in
our days, it is full of disorder and confusion. The
members that are capable and mindful of business are
few in number, and the rest mind nothing at all.
When there is a party job to be done, they’ll
attend, and make a hideous noise, like Bedlamites;
but if the House is to enter on business, such as the
giving of money or making of public laws, they converse
so loud with one another in private knots, that
nobody can know what is doing, except a very few
who, for that purpose, sit near the clerks’ table; or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
they leave the House and the Men of Business, as they
call them, to mind such matters.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE KING AND QUEEN.</i></div>

<p>In 1728, royalty continued to exhibit itself in a
manner which, now, seems rather unedifying. On
Sundays and Thursdays, in the summer, the city sent
curious multitudes to Hampton Court, to see their
Majesties dine in public. The sight-seers went freely
into the gallery, where a strong barrier divided them
from the royalties at table. On all occasions, the
pressure against this barrier was immense; on one, it
gave way, when scores of ladies and gentlemen were
sent sprawling at the foot of the king’s table. Away
went perukes and hats; for which there was a furious
scramble, with much misappropriation, more or less
accidental. While it lasted, king and queen held their
sides and laughed aloud, regardless of etiquette, or
indeed, of becomingness; but there was provocation
to hilarity, when the worshippers were rolling and
screaming at the feet of the national idols.</p>

<p>One of the latter showed how little he was prejudiced
against Jacobites when they had qualities which
outweighed their political defects. Dr. Freind, the
Jacobite physician, whom the Prince of Wales had
taken to St. James’s from the Tower, was, on the
Prince’s accession to the throne, appointed physician
to the queen. The doctor did not escape sneers and
inuendoes from his old friends. ‘Dr. John Freind,’
writes Mr. Morrice (June, 1728), ‘is a very assiduous
courtier, and must grow so more and more every day,
since his <i lang="la">quondam</i> friends and acquaintances shun and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
despise him; and whenever he happens to fall in the
way of them, he looks methinks very silly.’
<span class="sni"><i>ATTERBURY WEARY OF EXILE.</i></span>
Atterbury
in exile, on hearing of Freind’s death, in 1728,
remarked: ‘I dare say, notwithstanding his station at
Court, he died with the same political opinions with
which I left him.’ There was a talk in London of Atterbury
himself being at least weary of exile. His later
letters show some longing to die in his native land;
and Walpole seems to have been aware of the fact. In
October 1728, Atterbury’s son-in-law, Morrice, wrote
to the bishop,—‘I was assured near two months ago,
that Sir Robert Walpole had given out that you had
entirely shaken off the affair of a certain person,—were
grown perfectly weary of that drooping cause, and
had made some steps, by means of the Ambassador at
Paris, towards not being left out of the General Act of
Grace which, it is every now and then talked, will pass
the next Parliament; and that you desired above all
things to come home, and end your days in your own
country.’ The next Parliament, however, was not
disposed to lenity.</p>

<p>In the king’s speech, on opening the Session in
January, 1729, there was no reference to the Pretender.
The king, however, attributed certain delays at
the Courts of Vienna and Madrid to ‘hopes given from
hence of creating discontents and division’ among his
subjects; but if this hope encouraged these foreign
Courts, ‘I am persuaded,’ said the king, ‘that your
known affection for me, and a just regard for your own
honour, and the interest and security of the nation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
will determine you effectually to discourage the unnatural
and injurious practices of some few who
suggest the means of distressing their country, and
afterwards clamour at the inconveniences which they
themselves have occasioned.’ In the usual reply, the
Lords lamented that the lenity of the constitution was
daily abused, and that the basest and meanest of mankind
‘escape the infamous punishment due by the laws
of the land to such crimes.’ The Commons, after
some debate, employed terms equally strong.
<span class="sni"><i>THE PRINCE OF WALES AT CHURCH.</i></span>
The Heir
Apparent used the opportunity to illustrate his fidelity
to the Protestant succession. Prince Frederick, to convince
all good people of his Protestant orthodoxy, went
a round of the London churches. He was accompanied
by a group of young lords and gentlemen of good
character, and, at this time, his reputation did not
suffer by his being judged according to the company
he kept. On the occasion of his dissipated church-going,
the prince and his noble followers took the Sacrament
in public: the doors of the church, whichever
it might be, were set wide open, and the church itself
was packed by a mob of street Whigs and Tories, who
made their own comments on the spectacle, which was
not so edifying and impressive as it was intended to be.
Fog’s Jacobite paper hinted that a family not a hundred
miles from St. James’s was split up with petty domestic
quarrelling. The family, indeed, dined together twice
a week in public; but people were reminded that
outward appearances were exceedingly deceptive,—and
sacramental partakings (it was said) proved nothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE MORALS AND MANNERS OF THE TIME.</i></div>

<p>The papers of the year bear witness to the wickedness
and barbarity of all classes of people, of both
sexes. Half the highwaymen and footpads were members
of his Majesty’s own guards. There was not a
street or suburb of London that was free from their
violence and villany. Small offences being as much a
hanging matter as the most horrible crimes, lawless
men found it as cheap to be murderers as petty-larcenists;
and all looked to Tyburn as the last scene,
in which they must necessarily figure. Three or four
of these fellows, behind old Buckingham House,
stopped the carriage of the Bishop of Ossory, who was
on his way to Chelsea with his son. They took from
the prelate’s finger his episcopal ring (of great value),
and from his hand what seemed to be a pocket book,
but which was a Book of Common Prayer. When the
highwayman who held it saw that it was a Prayer
Book, he handed it back to the bishop. ‘Had you not
better keep it?’ said the prelate. ‘Thank you, no!’
rejoined the Pimlico Macheath, ‘we have no occasion
for it at present, whatever may be the case at some
time hereafter.’ The time alluded to was the hour of
‘hanging Wednesday,’ at Tyburn, when each patient
was provided with a Prayer Book, which he often
flung at someone in the crowd of spectators before he
was pinioned. There was always a great variety of company
at the triple tree in Tyburn field, built to accommodate
a score. At a push a couple of dozen could be
disposed of on a very busy hanging morning. The
sufferers ranged,—from the most brutal murderers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
men and women, down to timid pickpockets and shy
shoplifters, boys and girls, to all of whom the bloody
code of the time awarded the same measure of vengeance.
The London mob were almost satiated with
Tyburn holidays. It was an agreeable change for
them to witness the public military funeral of old Mary
Davis, who had served, both as sutler and soldier, in
our wars in Flanders. In her later years, Mary kept
a tavern in King Street, Westminster, bearing the
curious sign of ‘Man’s worst ills.’ The crowd there,
and about St. Margaret’s, where she was buried, was
as great as at their Majesties’ coronation.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ATTERBURY, ON MIST.</i></div>

<p>The press prosecutions of this year were few. A
vendor of some reprints of former very offensive numbers
of Mist’s Journal lost his liberty for a while; and
a poor servant girl, for delivering to a caller (who may
have been a police agent) an obnoxious pamphlet, was
sentenced to imprisonment in Bridewell, there to
receive ‘the correction of the house,’—which meant a
severe whipping.</p>

<p>No better proof of Atterbury’s sympathy with
Mist and the enemies of the established Government
can be given than in the following passage, from a
letter written at Montpellier, in March, 1729-30. It
is addressed to Sempill, who was a favoured resident
at the Chevalier’s Court, but really a spy in the service
of the Court in London.—‘I shall be concerned if so
honest a man as Mr. Mist should have any just cause
of uneasiness. His sufferings, that were intended to
distress and disgrace him, ought to render him in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
eyes of those for whom he suffered, more valuable;
and I hope it will prove so that others may not be discouraged.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THOMSON’S ‘SOPHONISBA.’</i></div>

<p>During the next ten years Jacobitisin in the capital
made no manifestation, but the Whig poets were
rather ostentatious in their loyalty; and the royal
family patronised them accordingly. For instance, on
the last day of February, 1730, Thomson produced
at Drury Lane his tragedy, illustrating the virtue of
patriotism, namely, ‘Sophonisba.’ The queen herself
had attended the full-dress rehearsals, at which crowded
audiences were not so much delighted as they were
told they ought to be. However, the notice the
queen condescended to take of this essay to keep
alive the virtue of patriotism, led the author to dedicate
it to Caroline. In that dedication the poet
informed both Whigs and Jacobites that the queen
‘commands the hearts of a people more powerful at sea
than Carthage, more flourishing in commerce than
those first merchants, more secure against conquest,
and under a monarchy more free than a commonwealth
itself.’ In the prologue it was said of <span class="lock">Britain,—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">When freedom is the cause, ’tis her’s to fight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And her’s, when freedom is the theme, to write.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the play Mrs. Oldfield splendidly illustrated the
spirit of patriotism, in the part of the heroine. Cibber
acted the subordinate part of <em>Scipio</em>, in which he
suffered at the hands of the Jacobites. These had not
forgotten the offence in his ‘Nonjuror;’ and joining,
hilariously savage with the critics who laughed at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
Cibber in tragedy, they hissed him off the stage and
out of the part on the second night. Williams, a
moderately good player, succeeded him as <em>Scipio</em>, and
he, on the third night, looked so like the ultra-Whig
actor, that the Jacobite spectators received him with
groans and hisses, which, however, speedily turned to
laughter and applause.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CIBBER MADE POET LAUREATE.</i></div>

<p>But Colley had his reward. The zeal he had displayed
against Jacks and Nonjurors, by producing his
famous comedy, now obtained its recompense, and his
sufferings their consolation. In 1730, Cibber was
appointed to the office of Laureate, with its annual
butt of sack, or the equivalent, 50<abbr title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr> Every Jacobite
who could pen a line, printed it against the laurelled
minstrel. Apollo himself was pressed into the Nonjuring
<span class="lock">faction:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Well,’ said Apollo, ‘still ’tis mine,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To give the real laurel,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">But, guessing who should have the luck</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>The year was one fruitful in plays; but it was
observed that when nuts are plentiful, they are generally
of poor quality; so it was with the plays of 1730.
They are all clean forgotten, including ‘Sophonisba’
itself,—the epilogue to which tragedy had this advice
to ladies who patronised foreign <span class="lock">productions:—</span></p>

</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>JACOBITE HEARNE.</i></div>

<p>There was much meanness in the ill feeling of the
Jacobites at even the little mischances that happened
to the royal family. On a dark evening in November,
the king and queen were returning from Kew to St.
James’s, their footmen and grooms carrying torches. A
storm of wind blew out the torches, and at Parson’s
Green the carriage and its royal freight was overturned.
Lord Peterborough’s people came to the rescue, with
flambeaux, and the royal pair went on to town with
nothing worse than an assortment of bruises. Such
accidents were kindly attributed to the drunkenness of
servants, but that bitter Jacobite Hearne thought that
the mistress, if not the master, could be as drunk as
they. Here is a sample of both thought and expression.—‘The
present Duchess of Brunswick, commonly
called Queen Caroline,’ says Hearne, in his ‘Reliquiæ,’
‘is a very proud woman, and pretends to great subtlety
and cunning. She drinks so hard that her spirits are
continually inflamed, and she is often drunk. The last
summer, she went away from Orkney House, near
Maidenhead (at which she had dined), so drunk that
she was sick in the coach all her journey, as she went
along;—a thing much noted.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A JACOBITE THREAT.</i></div>

<p>The Tories, on their side, were savagely mauled by
the Whig press. The old Jacobite fire of Earbery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
was thereby inflamed, especially by the attacks on the
old Tories in the ‘Craftsman.’ The former Stuart
champion, who, in 1717, fled the country to avoid the
consequences of publishing his ‘History of the Clemency
of our English Monarchs,’ but whose sentence
of outlawry was reversed in 1725, gave the ‘Craftsman’
warning, in the following advertisement, which
was in the ‘Evening Post,’ of September 26, 1730,—‘Whereas
the “Craftsman” has, for some time past,
openly declared himself to be a root and branch man,
and has made several unjust and scandalous reflections
upon the family of the Stuarts, not sparing even King
Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>, this is to give notice, that if he reflects
further upon any <span class="smcap">One</span> of that line, I shall shake his
rotten Commonwealth principles into atoms. <em>Matthias
Earbery.</em>’ The writer kept his word in his ‘Occasional
Historian.’</p>

<p>To decline to take the oath of abjuration was still a
very serious matter, involving not merely temporary
loss, but life-long professional ruin. Pope had a
nephew, Robert Rackett, whose position affords a striking
illustration of these Jacobite times. The story is
thus told by Pope himself, in a letter to Lord Oxford,
<abbr title="November">Nov.</abbr> 16, 1730: ‘It happens that a nephew of mine,
who, for his parents’ sins and not his own, was born a
papist, is just coming, after nine or ten years’ study and
hard service under an attorney, to practise in the law.
Upon this depends his whole well-being and fortune in
the world, and the hopes of his parents in his education,
all which must inevitably be frustrated by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
severity of a late opinion of the judges, who, for the
major part, have agreed to admit no attorney to be
sworn the usual oath which qualifies them to practise,
unless they also give them the oaths of allegiance and
supremacy.
<span class="sni"><i>DIFFICULTIES IN PROFESSIONAL LIFE.</i></span>
This has been occasioned solely by the
care they take to enforce an Act of Parliament, in the
last session but one, against fraudulent practices of attornies,
and to prevent men not duly qualified as attornies
from practising as such. It is very evident that
the intent of the Act is in no way levelled at papists, nor
in any way demands their being excluded from practising
more than they were formerly. Therefore, I
hope the favour of a judge may be procured, so far as
to admit him to take the usual attorney’s oath, without
requiring the religious one.’ Pope hopes one of the
judges will be good-natured enough to do this, and he
suggests Judge Price for Lord Oxford’s manipulation.
‘In one word the poor lad will be utterly undone in
this case, if this contrivance cannot be obtained in his
behalf.’ Lord Oxford applied, not to Price, but to
‘Baron C.’ (Carter or Comyns, as Mr. Elwin suggests).
This judge, says Pope (<abbr title="December">Dec.</abbr> 1730), ‘showed him what
possible regard he could, and lamented his inability to
admit any in that circumstance, as it really is a case of
compassion.’ Ultimately the obstacle seems to have
been surmounted. Within a few months of half
a century later, Pope’s nephew died in Devonshire
Street, London, where he had ‘clerks’ in his
employment. ‘He had, therefore,’ says Mr. Elwin
in a note to the letter from which the above extract<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
is taken, ‘managed to make his way in some line of
business.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>DEATH OF DEFOE.</i></div>

<p>In the year 1731 died a popular and political
writer, in the announcement of whose death neither
his popular works nor his provocating agency in the
service of Government is referred to. The event is thus
recorded in Read’s ‘Weekly,’ for May 1st, 1731: ‘A
few days ago died Mr. Defoe Sen., a person well known
for his numerous and various writings. He had a great
natural genius and understood very well the Trade
and Interest of this Kingdom. His Knowledge of Men,
especially of those in High Life, with whom he was
formerly very conversant, had weakened his Attachment
to any Party, but in the Main, he was in the
Interest of Civil and Religious Liberty, in behalf of
which he appeared on several remarkable Occasions.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">‘<i>FALL OF MORTIMER.</i>‘</div>

<p>In the month of July the Government began to
look sharply after political offences on the stage. At
the Haymarket Theatre, an historical tragedy, called
‘The Fall of Mortimer,’ was announced; and, in the
announcement the Ministry saw an attack on Walpole,
and probably on the queen. The grand jury of the
County of Middlesex delivered a long ‘presentment’
to the Court of King’s Bench, in which the new play
was described as ‘a false, infamous, scandalous, seditious,
and treasonable libel, written, acted, printed, and
published against the peace of our Sovereign Lord the
King, his crown and dignity.’ It is not clear that the
play was ever more than rehearsed. On the night it
was to have been regularly acted, a body of messengers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
and constables rushed through the stage door in
order to make capture of the players. These were
attired, and ready for the curtain to go up; Mullart, as
<i>Mortimer</i>, stood plumed and gallant at the centre of
the stage. At the first alarm, however, he and his
mates took to flight, decked out as they were, and succeeded
in escaping. This play, which some thirty years
later was again turned to political purpose, grew out
of the brief fragment and the sketched-out plot of a
play designed by Ben Jonson. In the few lines he
wrote, there are the following against upstarts and
courtiers. These were held to be adverse to Walpole’s
peace as well as the king’s. For <span class="lock">example:—</span></p>

</div>
</div>

<p>This matter passed over. A press war sprang up
in another direction.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>DUELS AND SERMONS.</i></div>

<p>Lord Hervey published a pamphlet called, ‘Sedition
and Defamation Displayed.’ An anonymous author
speedily followed it up by ‘a Proper Reply to a late
scandalous libel, called “Sedition and Defamation displayed.”’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
Hervey challenged William Pulteney, the reputed
author of the Proper Reply. The parties fought
in the new walk in the upper part of St. James’s Park.
Their respective friends, Sir John Rushout and Henry
Fox looked on, while the adversaries made passes at
each other; but, when they closed, the seconds rushed
in, parted, and disarmed them. A little plaister was
all the remedy required to cover all the damage done
by a few scratches on Lord Hervey’s person. Pulteney’s
name, however, was struck out of the Council
Book, and he was ignominiously put out of the commission
of the peace.</p>

<p>The royal family proceeded to show that there was
no prejudice on their part against the noble art of
printing. A printing press and cases were put up at
St. James’s House (as the old palace used to be called),
and the noble art of printing was exhibited before their
majesties. The future victor of Culloden, the Duke of
Cumberland, worked at one of the cases. He set up
in type a little book, of which he was the author, called
‘The Laws of Dodge Hare.’ The duke, at this time,
also took lessons in ivory-turning, which was considered
to be a ‘most healthful exercise.’ Generally on Sunday,
while the king and queen were in the Chapel
Royal, one of the Bishop of London’s chaplains preached
to the young Duke and the Princesses Mary and Louisa
in his royal highness’s apartment! As his royal highness
had recently stood godfather, in person, to the son
and heir of Lord Archibald Hamilton, he was supposed
to be of importance enough to be thus preached to.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
The young princesses were thrown in to make up a
juvenile congregation.</p>

<p>Very much seems to have been made of the young
duke this year, as if he had a mission to perform. A
little establishment was set up for him, and he became
a ‘personage.’ The papers solemnly proclaimed how
the Duke of Cumberland appeared in public, for the
first time, with his own coach and livery servants. He
paid a visit to Sir Robert Walpole, in Arlington Street,
and went afterwards to Major Foubert’s Riding House
(on the site of what is now called Major Foubert’s Passage,
Regent Street), and there received his first lesson
in riding.</p>

<p>The only manifestation of party feeling this year
was made by the citizens of London. A subscription
had been entered into for the casting of a statue of
William <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> When it was executed, the city, influenced
by Jacobite feeling, refused to receive it. Bristol
was more loyal. The citizens there bought the effigy
that London despised, and William soon stood erect in
the midst of Queen Square.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>YOUNG LORD DERWENTWATER.</i></div>

<p>Among the miscellaneous chronicling of the year,
there is one made by most of the Saturday papers to
this effect: ‘Yesterday, Friday, August 19th, the Lord
Derwentwater arrived at his house in Poland Street,
from France.’ This was John, the late earl’s only son.
He came to London to consult Chiselden, the great
physician. He was hopelessly ill of dropsy; and a
double sympathy attracted crowds of Jacobites to resort
to Poland Street to manifest their respect for the suffering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
son of one of the martyrs to the cause of the
Stuarts.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A STANDING ARMY.</i></div>

<p>When in 1732 the National Defences became a
serious matter for consideration, the Jacobites affected
to think that an army of 12,000 men would suffice for
the protection of the realm. The Whigs insisted that
at least 17,000 would be required for its defence. The
London Whig papers asserted that 4,000 men would
have all their work to do in keeping Scotland quiet.
The fortified towns of England would require 2,000
men. The remainder would not be sufficiently strong
in numbers, for sudden emergencies, if the total was
only to be 12,000. Such insufficiencies would leave
many places without defence. This would encourage
Risings. Open insurrection would lead to foreign invasion,
with the Pretender at the head of it. The wind
that would bring over his hostile fleet would shut up
our own in our harbours. Why had Jacobitism increased
tenfold in the last four years of Queen Anne?
Because the High Priests had been unmuzzled, and the
necessary forces had been disbanded. The Preston
Rebellion, as the outbreak of 1715 was contemptuously
called, would never have happened at all if we had had
17,000 men under arms. As it was, it was crushed
not by the bravery or ability of our troops and officers,
but by the incapacity and timidity of the rebels themselves.
So ran Whig comments in Parliament.</p>

<p>Unless the Government in London were sure that
there were as many majorities in all Corporations
against the Chevalier’s pretensions as there were ‘in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
certain places against King William’s statue,’ the administration
was conjured to keep up the numbers of the
army. While the Jacobites had hopes, England must
entertain fears. Had Louis <abbr title="Fourteen">XIV.</abbr> lived a few months
longer, a French army would have been in full march
to seat the Chevalier on a throne at Westminster. The
Regent, Duke of Orleans, did not help the Pretender,
simply because he needed our alliance against Spain
which refused to recognise his Regency.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE DUKE’S GRENADIERS.</i></div>

<p>At home there was a seeming fixed determination
that the Duke of Cumberland <em>should</em> be a soldier, and
be trained to the ability necessary to meet future emergencies.
The youthful prince had military inclinations.
That military spirit was stimulated by the formation of
a company of youthful grenadiers out of a dozen sons
of persons of quality. Their dress resembled the
uniform of the 2nd Foot Guards. ‘His Royal Highness
the Duke,’ say the journals of the day, ‘diverts himself
with acting as corporal, choosing to rise regularly in
Preferment. The number being but twelve, is to be
increased.’ Fog’s Jacobite journal says maliciously,—‘increased
in case of War.’</p>

<p>Observance of the solemn anniversary of the 30th
of January used to be considered as a protest that all
parties might make against ‘the sin of rebellion.’ However
this may be, reverence for the Royal Martyr seems
to have suffered some diminution in the year 1732.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>GENERAL ROGUERY.</i></div>

<p>When Dr. Hare, Bishop of Chichester, preached
before the House of Lords, in the Abbey, on the 30th
of January, the only peers present were the Lord Chancellor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
Lord Onslow, and the Bishops of Peterborough,
Lincoln, Lichfield and Coventry, St. David’s, and
Rochester. The sermon was thoroughly political. The
text was from Proverbs xxiv. 21, ‘My son, fear thou
the Lord and the king: and meddle not with them
that are given to change.’ The sermon was described
as ‘most extraordinary; the preacher vindicated the
King’s honour and sincerity in his concessions to the
Parliament;’ and he insisted strongly on the uses of
‘keeping up the day.’</p>

<p>Later, the Jacobites found some little satisfaction
in the smart reprimand delivered by the Speaker
of the House of Commons to Sir John Eyles, for
directing the secretary of the Commissioners for the
sale of forfeited estates to set his name to an order for
the disposal of the Earl of Derwentwater’s estates, in
the sale of which, great frauds were discovered. But
where was fraud not found at that time? From the
benches of Parliament to the council-room of the
Charity Commissioners, rogues abounded; the country
was sold by the Senate, and the poor were plundered
by their trustees. Yet, these things caused less emotion in
the London coffee-houses than the report which came
of the death of Bishop Atterbury at Paris, in February.
The event was simply recorded in the ‘Gentleman’s

<div class="sidenote"><i>DEATH OF ATTERBURY.</i></div>

<p>‘<i>February 15, 1732.</i>—The Revd. Dr. Francis Atterbury,
late Bishop of Rochester, died at Paris, justly
esteemed for his great learning and polite conversation.’
In what sense the Jacobites esteemed him may be seen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
in an expression in one of Salkeld’s letters, wherein the
writer laments the loss of ‘that anchor of our hopes,
that pillar of our cause.’</p>

<p>Pope, in a letter to Lord Oxford, referred to Atterbury’s
death in these terms: ‘The trouble which I have
received from abroad, on the news of the death of that
much-injured man, could only be mitigated by the
reflection your Lordship suggests to me—his own
happiness, and return into his best country, where only
honesty and virtue were sure of their reward.’ Pope
could not have thought the ex-bishop innocent of the
treason, of which he was undoubtedly guilty; for the
poet had knowledge of the treachery before the Jacobite
prelate’s death. Samuel Wesley must have known
it too, but he ignored all but his patron’s virtues in a
very long elegy on Atterbury’s decease, written in very
strong language, of which these lines are a <span class="lock">sample:—</span></p>

    <div class="verse indent0">To insult the great, the venerable, dead;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let truth resistless blast their guilty eyes!</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">—which is a sort of malediction that is now quite discarded
by moral and by fashionable poets.</p>

<p>The ‘Craftsman’ of May 6th announces the arrival
of Mr. Morrice, the High Bailiff of Westminster, at
Deal. On landing he was taken into custody and sent
up prisoner to London, where, after being rigorously
examined by one of the Secretaries of State, he was admitted
to bail. The corpse of the ex-bishop was arrested
as it came up the river. It was taken to the Custom
House, where, the coffin being examined for papers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
and nothing compromising being found, the body, according
to the facetious ‘Craftsman,’ was discharged
without bail. Great opposition was made to a request
for burial in the Abbey; and when this was granted,
the ‘Craftsman’ was ‘not certain as to the usual
Church ceremony being read over the corpse.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>BURIAL OF ATTERBURY.</i></div>

<p>The public were, at all events, kept in the dark,
lest Jacobite mobs should make riotous demonstrations
at the ceremony. ‘On Friday, May 12th,’ says Sylvanus
Urban, ‘the Corpse of Bishop Atterbury was privately
interred in his Vault in Westminster Abbey. On the
Urn which contained his Bowels, &amp;c., was inscribed:
“In hac Urnâ depositi sunt cineres Francisci Atterburi
Episcopi Roffensis.” Among his papers brought over
by Mr. Morrice was “Harmonia Evangelica,” in a new
and clearer Method than any yet publish’d. ’Tis also
said he translated Virgil’s “Georgics,” which he sent
to a friend with the following Lines prefix’d,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">Quos colui, patriæque memor, neque degener usquam.’</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>They who were of the prelate’s way of thinking
made him, in one sense, speak, or be felt, even in his
grave. The body of the Jacobite Bishop of Rochester
had scarcely been deposited at the west end of the
south aisle of Westminster Abbey, of which he had
been the Dean, when copies of an epigrammatic epitaph
were circulating from hand to hand, and were being
read with hilarity or censure in the various London<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
coffee-houses and taverns. It ran to another tune than
that made upon him by Prior, <span class="lock">namely:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">His foes, when dead great Atterbury lay,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shrunk at his corse, and trembled at his clay.</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">T’ insult a deathless corse, alas! is vain;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Well for themselves, and well employ’d their pain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Could they secure him,—not to rise again!</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The printsellers reaped a harvest by selling the
Bishop’s portrait. The most popular was sold by
Cholmondely in Holborn, but he was had up before
the Secretary of State, and was terrified by that official
into suppressing the sale.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>AT SCARBOROUGH.</i></div>

<p>All London, that is, what Chesterfield called ‘the
Quality,’ went seaward in August. The cream of them
settled on the Scarborough sands. ‘Bathing in the
sea,’ says Chesterfield, ‘is become the general practice
of both sexes.’ He gives an amusing account of how
‘the Quality’ from London looked, at Scarborough, and
he jokes, in his peculiar fashion, upon plots, Jacobites,
and ministers. He writes to the Countess of Suffolk:
‘The ladies here are innumerable, and I really believe
they all come for their healths, for they look very ill.
The men of pleasure are Lord Carmichael, Colonel Ligonier,
and the celebrated Tom Paget, who attend upon
the Duke of Argyle all day, and dance with the pretty
ladies at night. Here are, besides, hundreds of Yorkshire
beaux, who play the inferior parts and, as it were,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
only tumble, while those three dance upon the high
ropes of gallantry. The grave people are mostly malignants
or, in ministerial language, “notorious Jacobites,”
such as Lord Stair, Marchmont, Anglesea, and
myself, not to mention many of the House of Commons
of equal disaffection. Moreover, Pulteney and Lord
Cartaret are expected here soon; so that if the Ministry
do not make a plot of this meeting, it is plain they do
not want one for this year.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>NOTORIOUS JACOBITES.</i></div>

<p>Chesterfield was branded as a ‘notorious Jacobite,’
because he had opposed Walpole’s famous Excise
Bill, this year. As a consequence, he was deprived of
his staff of office as Lord Steward of the Household.
While Chesterfield was writing so airily to Lady Suffolk,
the king was laying out 3,000<abbr title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr> in repairing the Palace
of Holyrood. A dozen years later, when ‘news frae
Moidart’ reached the London Jacobites, they laughed
at the idea of the ‘Duke of Brunswick’ having made
Holyrood suitable for the reception of Charles Edward,
Prince of Wales.</p>

<p>In the meantime a voice here and there from the
metropolitan pulpits ventured to hope the king would
be kept by divine guidance, in a safe groove. The
future hero of Culloden was taking lessons in philosophy
from Whiston, and in mathematics from Hawksbee;
and, at a funeral more public than Atterbury’s, the
Jacobites assembled in Poland Street, to pay a last
mark of respect to the ‘Earl of Derwentwater,’ the
patient whom great Cheselden could not save, and whose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
<div class="sidenote"><i>THE EARL OF DERWENTWATER.</i></div>

<p>corpse was carried to Brussels to be deposited by the
side of that of his mother, Anne Webb. The so-called
‘Earl’ John, son of the attainted and beheaded peer,
as a sick man, was left unmolested, though he called
himself by a title unrecognised by the Government.</p>

<span class="smcap">he</span> feverish imagination of Tories who were
decided Jacobites also, saw impossible
reasons for every event. From the 23rd
to the 30th of January, 1733, there raged
in the metropolis what would probably now be called
an influenza. The disease was then known as the
‘London head-ache and fever;’ and it was fatal in
very many cases. Some of the Jacobites at once
discovered and proclaimed the cause and the effect of
this visitation, which carried off fifteen hundred persons
in the metropolis. Observe the two dates. ‘On
the 23rd of January, 1649, Charles denied the jurisdiction
of his Judges, who, nevertheless, sent him to the
block on the 30th.’ The week of mortal fever and
headache was only an instalment of that former week’s
work which ended in the martyrdom of the Chevalier
de St. George’s grandfather! Horace Walpole asserts
that George <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> always attended Church on the 30th of
January. The king and the whole Court went thither
in mourning. All who had service to perform at Court,
put on sables. The king’s sister, the Queen of Prussia,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
was a declared Jacobite, ‘as is more natural,’ says
Walpole, ‘for all princes who do not personally profit
by the ruin of the Stuarts.’<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>APPROACHING STORM.</i></div>

<p>The royal speech on opening Parliament was of a
peaceful character. The Lords re-echoed it in their
address, but in the Commons, both Sir John Barnard
and Shippen moved amendments to the address, from
that House. The speech had recommended an avoidance
of all heats and animosities. The theme of Barnard
and Shippen was that the liberties and the trade
of the nation were probably menaced; that a general
terror was spreading of something being about to be
introduced, perilous, nay destructive, to both. Men of
all parties being subject to this terror, ‘they cannot,’
said Shippen, ‘be branded with the name of Jacobites
or Republicans, nor can it be said that this opposition
is made by Jacobites or Republicans. No, the whole
people of England seem to be united in this spirit of
jealousy and opposition.’ The address, of course, was
carried. But a storm was approaching.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>WYNDHAM IN PARLIAMENT.</i></div>

<p>This year, 1733, was the year of the famous debates
on the motions for a permanent increase of the army,
and on the Excise question introduced by Walpole, who
proposed to transfer the duties on wine and tobacco
from the Customs to the Excise. The two propositions
set the country in a flame. The universal cry was that
they were two deadly blows at trade and liberty. The
first proposal was carried; Walpole, under pressure of
large minorities against him in the House, and larger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
adverse majorities out of it, withdrew the Excise measure.
All his opponents were branded by his partisans
as Jacobites and something more. This gave opportunity
to the Jacobites in Parliament, and increased the
vigour of their opposition. It was against the motion
for increasing the number of the Land Forces, that the
‘Patriot’ Sir William Wyndham spoke with almost
fierce sarcasm. ‘As for the Pretender, he did not
believe there was any considerable party for him in
this nation. That pretence had always been a ministerial
device made use of only for accomplishing their
own ends; but it was a mere bugbear, a raw head
and bloody bones fit only to frighten children; for he
was very well convinced his Majesty reigned in the
hearts and affections of his people, upon that his
Majesty’s security depended; and if it did not depend
on that, the illustrious family now on the throne could
have little security in the present number, or in any
number, of the standing forces.’</p>

<p>A few press prosecutions, a few imprisonments of
Jacobite tipplers who <em>would</em> drink the health of King
James in the streets, or call it out in church services;
a weeding-out of disorderly soldiers from otherwise
trustworthy regiments; and a little trouble arising from
pulpit indiscretions, are the only symptoms of yet
uncertain times, to be detected. The ‘Craftsman,’ of
August 4th, chronicles the discharge of ‘several Private
Gentlemen out of the Lord Albemarle’s troop of Life
Guards, some as undersized, and others as superannuated,
but such have been allowed fifty guineas each and their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
college. His Lordship proposes to give every Private
Gentleman in his Troop a new Surtout and a pair of
Buckskin breeches, at his own Expense.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>POLITICAL SERMON.</i></div>

<p>Later, in the autumn, preachers took for a subject
the want of respect manifested, by the mass of people,
for their ‘betters,’ including all that were in authority.
On Saturday, October 13th, the ‘Craftsman’ had this
paragraph, showing how the pulpit was lending itself to
politics as well as to morals:—‘Last Sunday a very
remarkable sermon was preached at a <em>Great Church in
the City</em>, against speaking evil of dignities, in which the
Preacher endeavoured to show the unparalleled wickedness
and Impudence of Tradesmen meddling in Politicks,
and particularly of their riotous Procession to
Westminster to petition against the late Excise scheme
(so <em>evidently calculated for their good</em>), which he placed
among the number of Deadly Sins, and recommended
Passive Obedience and Non-Resistance, for which the
Audience were so unkind as to laugh at him so much
that he shut up his book before he had done and
threatened them with a severe Chastisement.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>STORMY DEBATES.</i></div>

<p>The fear of the ‘Pretender,’ the recruiting in
back parts of London for ‘foreign service,’ and the
relations of England with Continental powers, kept up
a troubled spirit among those who wished to live at
home, at ease. One of the most remarkable debates of
the session occurred in the House of Lords. The king
had exercised, and wished to continue to exercise, a
right (such as he supposed himself to possess) of dismissing
officers from the army, without a court martial.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
The Duke of Marlborough (Spencer) brought in a Bill to
prevent such summary expulsion, at the king’s pleasure.
In the course of the debate the figure of the Pretender
was brought forward. The Duke of Newcastle warmly
supported the king’s ‘prerogative.’ There would be
no safety, he said, unless the king held that right.
‘There is,’ he remarked, ‘at present a Pretender to the
Crown of these realms, and we may conclude that
there will always be plots and contrivances in this
kingdom against the person in possession of the throne.
While there is a Pretender, he may have his agents in
the army as well as he has everywhere else.’ Officers
(according to the duke) might be led away from their
duty, and he held it to be unjust to the king to deprive
him of the right to dismiss officers suspected of Jacobitism,
or known to be disloyal, on evidence which a
court martial might not think sufficient for cashiering
them. The Bill was lost, and to the king was left the
power of doing wrong.</p>

<p>In a portion of the Duke of Newcastle’s speech he
asserted that the right claimed for the king was indispensable,
on the ground that not only were private soldiers
being recruited in London for ‘foreign service,’ but that
officers might be tampered with, and that there was
no real security that a general-in-chief might not be
seduced into the enemy’s camp. This spread some
alarm. The debates, indeed, were supposed to be
delivered in private, but what was called ‘the impudence
of some fellows’ gave all that was essential to
the public. For defence of the nation, however, every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
precaution had been taken. Early in the spring, a
fleet of twenty sail of the line was sent to the Downs.
Eight regiments were brought from Ireland to England.
It is certain that these precautions preserved the public
tranquility of the kingdom.
<span class="sni"><i>THE YOUNG CHEVALIER.</i></span>
Young Prince Charles
Edward was serving ‘with particular marks of distinction’
in the army of Don Carlos; and the boy gave
no obscure hints that he would, whenever it was in his
power, favour the pretensions of his family. An exclamation
of Sergeant Cotton, at a review in Hyde Park,
that he would shoot the king; and the fact that the
sergeant’s musket was loaded with ball, and that he
had a couple of bullets in his pocket which had no
right to be there, seemed to imply that Cotton was
ready to favour the Stuart family’s pretensions.</p>

<p>The metropolis, moreover, was disturbed this year
by the appearance of strangers in the streets, with more
or less of a military air about many of them. These
were, however, for the most part, Jacobites who were
void of offence, and who had hastily come over from
France. The Government there had given them a
taste of what it was to live under such a system in
Church and State as the Stuarts would establish in
England, if they could get permanent footing there.
A royal edict was published throughout France, peremptorily
commanding all English, Irish, and Scotch,
of the ages between eighteen and fifty, who were without
employment, to enter the French army, within a
fortnight. Disobedience to this edict was to be <a id="chg1">punished</a>:—civilians,
by condemnation to the galleys;—men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
who had formerly served, to be shot as deserters!
Those who were not fortunate enough to get away from
such a paternal Government found friends in the
ministers of that George <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> whom they still styled
‘Duke of Brunswick’ and ‘Elector of Hanover.’ Lord
Waldegrave, the British Ambassador in France, sharply
censured the edict, remonstrated against the injustice
of treating the persons named in the edict worse than
the natives of any other country, and pointed to the
ingratitude of the French Government for various good
service rendered to it by England on recent occasions.
There was not a place in London where men met, but
there Lord Waldegrave’s health was drunk. Whatever
the politics of the drinkers were, all parties were
glad to find a cause for drinking which carried unanimity
with it.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>LORD DUFFUS.</i></div>

<p>There was another Jacobite incident of the year,
not without interest. Queen Anne’s old naval captain,
the gallant Kenneth, Lord Duffus, when attainted for
his share in the affair of 1715, was in safety in Sweden,
but he gave formal notice of his intention to repair to
England and surrender himself. On his way, the
British Minister at Hamburg had him arrested, and he
held Lord Duffus prisoner till after the limited time
had elapsed for the surrender of attainted persons.
Lord Duffus was brought captive to London, was shut
up in the Tower, and, destitute of means, was maintained
at the expense of Government. By the Act of
Grace, of 1717, he obtained his liberty, and he subsequently
entered the naval service of Russia. At his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
death, he left an only son, Eric Sutherland (whose
mother was a Swedish lady) who, in this year, 1734, at
the age of twenty-four, claimed the reversal of his
father’s attainder (as Lord Duffus was forcibly prevented
from obeying the statute), and his own right to
succeed to the baronial title. The claim excited much
interest while it was being pursued; and there was
some disappointment in Jacobite circles when the Lords
came to a decision that the claimant had no right to
the honour, title, and dignity of Baron Duffus. Eric
was, at this time, a loyal officer in the British army; he
died in 1768. He left a son, James, born in 1747,
who was restored to the title, by Act of Parliament, in
1826, when he was in his eightieth year. He enjoyed
it only a few months. His successor, Benjamin, died
in 1875, when the title became extinct.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE CALVES’ HEAD CLUB.</i></div>

<p>The 30th of January 1735 was kept in memory by other
means than ‘services’ before the Senate, and others in
the parish churches. By a tradition which was founded
in a lie, and which rooted itself and grew in the public
mind by additional lying, there was a popular belief
that a Calves’ Head Club, from the time of Cromwell,
had a special meeting and dinner on every anniversary
of the death of King Charles, to dishonour his memory.
The calf’s head served at table was in derisive
memory of the decollated head of that sovereign; and
the ocean of liquor drunk was in joyous celebration of
those who brought about the monarch’s death. The
story was a pure invention, but the invention led to a
sort of realisation of the story. Here and there, anti-Jacobites<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
observed the 30th of January as a festival.
<span class="sni"><i>THE CALVES’ HEAD RIOT.</i></span>
Hearne mentions a dinner given on that day by a
number of young men at All Soul’s College, Oxford.
They had ordered a calf’s head to be served up, but
the cook refused to supply it. He unwittingly, however,
gave the guests an opportunity of declaring their
approval of the sentence executed on Charles, by
sending them a dish of woodcocks, and these the
audacious Oxford Whigs solemnly decapitated. In the
present year, 1735, occurred the famous Calves’ Head
riot at and in front of a tavern in Suffolk Street.
According to the record, some noblemen and gentlemen
had the traditional dinner on the above day,
when they exhibited to the mob, which had assembled
in the street, a calf’s head in a napkin dipped in
claret to represent blood, and the exhibitors, each with
a claret-stained napkin—in his hand and a glass of
strong liquor in the other, drank anti-Stuart toasts,
and finally flung the head into a bonfire which they
had commanded to be kindled in front of the house.
The Jacobite mob broke into the house and would
have made ‘martyrs’ of the revellers but for the
timely arrival of the guards. Now, with regard to
this incident, there are two opposite and contemporary
witnesses, whose testimony nevertheless is not irreconcilable.
The first is ‘a lady of strong political tendencies
and too busy in matters of taste to be ignorant
of party movements.’ She is so described by a correspondent
of the ‘Times,’ who, under the signature
‘Antiquus,’ sent to that paper a few years ago the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
following copy of a letter, written by the lady, and
forming one of a collection of old letters in the possession
of ‘Antiquus, of Lincoln’s <span class="lock">Inn’:—</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE ‘30TH OF JANUARY.’</i></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘I suppose you have heard of the Suffolk-street
Expedition on the Thirtieth of January, and who the
blades were; they went and bespoke a dinner of
calves’ heads at the Golden Eagle, and afterwards
ordered a bonfire at the door, then came all to the
window with handkerchiefs dipt in blood, and shook
them out, and dress’d up a calf’s head in a nightcap
and had it thrown into the bonfire. The mob gather’d
about the door and were exceedingly inraged, so that
they broke ye door open and broke all the windows,
and threw fire into the house. The gentlemen were
forc’d to take sanctuary in the garret, and had not the
Guards been sent for the house would have been pull’d
down and the actors, no doubt, pull’d to pieces.</p>

<p>‘<abbr title="February">Feb.</abbr> 5, 1734-5.’</p>

<p>‘The list of the British worthies I formerly sent you
an account of are as follows:—Lord Middlesex, Lord
Harcourt, Lord Boyne, and Lord Middleton—Irish;
Lord John Murray, Sir James Grey, Mr. Smith, Mr.
Stroud, and, some say, Mr. Shirley. Lord A. Hamilton
dined with them, but, I am told, went away before the
riot began.</p>

<p>‘<abbr title="February">Feb.</abbr> 16, 1734-5.’</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>OBJECTIONABLE TOASTS.</i></div>

<p>Unfortunately, the name of the writer of the above
letter is not given. On the other hand, a letter written
by one of the guests, a week earlier than the above,
has often been published. Therein, Lord Middlesex<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
informs Spence, then at Oxford, that he and seven
others met at the Golden Eagle to dine, without any
thought as to what the date of the month was. The
eight included men of various political and religious
principles. Lord Middlesex says nothing as to the
dishes served up, but he states that all the guests had
drunk hard and some were very drunk indeed, when,
happening to go to the window, they saw a bonfire in
the street, and straightway ordered fresh faggots, by
which they had a bonfire of their own. <em>Then</em>, they
remembered the day, and fearful of the consequences
of this demonstration, the soberer part of the guests
proposed, from the open windows, loyal toasts to be
drunk by all. To a Jacobite mob this was an aggravation
of insult, for to drink the king, the Protestant
succession, and the administration, was to express
affection for what they cordially hated. The mob
besieged the house, and then made an ugly rush to get
at the offenders, which, however, was checked by the
arrival of the soldiers. Lord Middlesex says that the
leader of the mob was ‘an Irishman and a priest
belonging to Imberti, the Venetian Envoy.’</p>

<p>In the pulpits of the chapels of some of the foreign
ambassadors,—most Christian, most Catholic, or most
Apostolic,—the preachers, naturally enough, expounded
Christianity in a politico-religious point of view.
The Protestant-succession papers speak of them as a
daring vanguard dashing forward to secure improved
and fixed positions. Of course, the preachers, when supporting
the Papacy, were advocating the Pretender by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
whom, were the Stuarts restored, the Papacy would be
supported. This led to an outburst of anti-papal
sermons from half the London pulpits. Secker, the
ex-dissenter, ex-medical student, and now Bishop of
Bristol, was at the head of this body. They preached
sermons against Popery in a long and fiery series, in
some cases to the extent of two or three dozen.
Where, on one side doctrines were sincerely held which
made the other side sincerely shudder, as at awful blasphemy,
charity got sadly mauled and knocked about.
<span class="sni"><i>FOSTER, IN THE OLD JEWRY.</i></span>
It occurred to James Foster, the celebrated Baptist
who had passed through Arianism and Socinianism,
before he became a Trinitarian, that good citizens of
both churches and factions might be made even better
by their understanding the excellence of charity. His
pulpit in the Old Jewry became accordingly a point to
which men of opposite opinions resorted,—just indeed
as they did to the Popish ambassadorial chapel, where
they could hear <i lang="la">gratis</i> the great tenor Farinelli sing
mellifluously. In reference to Foster, the general
‘Evening Post,’ of March 25th, says that on the previous
Sunday evening, ‘upwards of a hundred Gentlemen’s
coaches came to the Rev. Mr. Foster’s lecture in the
Old Jewry. It must give,’ adds the newswriter, ‘a
great Satisfaction to that ingenious and polite Preacher,
to see such an Audience at his Lectures, as well as to
be a Reputation to his Hearers, in their discovering a
disposition to be pleased with his useful and instructive
Discourses, they turning upon the Truth, Excellency,
and Usefulness of the grand Parts of Moral Science;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
not tending to support private or party egotism of
Religion, or Rule of Conduct, but a Conduct founded on
the most sacred Rights of Mankind, a universal Liberty,
and a diffusive and extensive Benevolence.’</p>

<p>Another account states that ‘at his chapel there
was a confluence of persons of every rank, station, and
quality; wits, freethinkers, and numbers of the regular
clergy who, while they gratified their curiosity, had
their prepossessions shaken and their prejudices
loosened.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE QUEEN AND THE ARTIST.</i></div>

<p>There was one Jacobite who died this year, whose
prejudices were never in the least degree softened,
namely, Hearne, the antiquary. Richardson the
painter, when party spirit between Whig and Tory,
Hanoverian and Jacobite raged bitterly, was as severe
in a remark to Queen Caroline, as Hearne was in what
he wrote upon her. The queen once visited Richardson’s
studio to view his series of portraits of the kings
of England. Her Majesty pointed to the portrait of
a stern-looking individual between those of Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>
and <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> She very well knew the likeness was that
of a man who had helped to dethrone the Stuarts
on whose throne her husband was seated, and she
therefore might have entertained a certain respect for
him; but she asked the artist if he called that personage
a king? ‘No, madam,’ answered the undaunted
Richardson, ‘he is no King, but it is good for Kings to
have him among them as a memento!’</p>

<p>The queen’s favourite painter, Anniconi, was
more of a courtier than blunt Richardson. To that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
artist who, for a season, drew the ‘Quality’ to Great
Marlborough Street, she gave an order to paint a
picture, which was designed as a gift to the young
Duke of Cumberland’s tutor, Mr. Poyntz. It was an
allegorical composition, in which the queen herself
was to be seen delivering her royal son to the Goddess
of Wisdom,—who bore the features of Mrs. Poyntz.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CHESTERFIELD’S WIT.</i></div>

<p>The year 1736 may be said to have opened merrily,
with Chesterfield’s paper in ‘Fog’s Journal,’ on ‘An
Army in Wax Work.’ In the course of this lively essay,
the writer argues that since the English army had not
been of the slightest active use during many years, in
time of war,—a waxen army (to be ordered of Mrs.
Salmon, the wax-work woman) would be cheap and
sufficient in time of peace. He then alludes to the
Government cry against all who opposed it. ‘Let
nobody put the “Jacobite” upon me, and say that I
am paving the way for the Pretender, by disbanding
the army. That argument is worn threadbare; besides,
let those take the “Jacobite” to themselves who would
exchange the affections of the people for the fallacious
security of an unpopular standing army.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>SCENE IN WESTMINSTER HALL.</i></div>

<p>While there were, at this time, Nonjurors worthy of
the esteem of honourable men of all parties, there
were others who were contemptible for their spitefulness,
and for the silliness with which they displayed it.
Here is an example. Parliament had passed the Gin
Act, the Mortmain Act, the Westminster Bridge Act,
the Smugglers’ Act, and the Act for borrowing 600,000<abbr title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr>
on the Sinking Fund. A difference of opinion might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
exist as to the merits of one or two of these Acts, but
there was no justification for the method taken by one
person to show his hostility. On July 14th, in Westminster
Hall, while the Courts were sitting therein, a
bundle, dropped in front of the Court of Chancery, suddenly
exploded, and blew into the air a number of
handbills, which announced that, on this, the last day
of term, copies of the above-named Acts would be
publicly burned in the hall during the afternoon!
One of the bills was handed in to the judges in the
Court of King’s Bench, where it was presented as a
false and scandalous libel. Three days later a proclamation
was issued for the discovery of the persons
concerned in this outrage, and a reward of 200<abbr title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr>
offered for the respective arrests of either the author,
printer, or disperser of the handbills. This led to the
arrest, trial, and conviction of the Rev. Mr. Nixon, a
brainless Nonjuring clergyman, who was proved to be
the author of the bills, and the blower-up of the bundle
of crackers. On the 7th of December he was condemned
to pay 200 marks, to be imprisoned for five
years, and to be paraded before the different Courts, in
the Hall, with a parchment round his head—a sort of
foolscap—bearing a summary of his audacious offence.
A portion of this sentence was fulfilled soon after, and,
finally, this foolish Nonjuror was required to find
security for his good behaviour during the remainder
of his life.</p>

<p>This daring, yet stupid, act was supposed to be part
of an organised Jacobite plot. In the month of April,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
when Frederick, Prince of Wales, was married to the
Princess of Saxe-Gotha, Sir Robert Walpole had
information which set him on his guard. After the
explosion in Westminster Hall, he wrote a letter to his
brother Horace, in which the following passage is to be
found:—‘Since my coming to town I have been endeavouring
to trace out the authors and managers of
that vile transaction, and there is no reason to doubt
that the whole was projected and executed by a set of
low Jacobites, who talked of setting fire to the gallery
built for the marriage of the Princess Royal, by a preparation
which they call <em>phosphorus</em>, which takes fire
from the air. Of this I have had an account from the
same fellow that brought me these, and many such sorts
of intelligencies.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>JACOBITES AND GIN-DRINKERS.</i></div>

<p>And again, in September, when it was decreed that
unlicensed dealing in gin should cease, riots occurred,
and more than mere rioting was intended, in the metropolis,
about Michaelmas. On this occasion Sir Robert
wrote to his brother:—‘I began to receive accounts
from all quarters of the town that the Jacobites were
busy and industrious, in endeavouring to stir up the
common people and make an advantage of the universal
clamour that prevailed among the populace at the
expiration of their darling vice.’ The Jacobite idea
was, according to the information received by Walpole,
to make the populace drunk <i lang="la">gratis</i> by unlimited supplies
of gin from the distilleries, and then turning them
loose in London to do such work as such inspiration was
likely to suggest to them; but an efficient display of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
the constitutional forces was sufficient to preserve the
peace of the metropolis.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE STAGE FETTERED.</i></div>

<p>The alleged abuse of the liberty of the press and of
that of the stage was denounced, as all opposition to
the Government was, as the work of Jacobites for
the subversion ‘of our present happy establishment.’
The Government undoubtedly hoped, by suppressing
the liberty of satire on the stage, to be enabled to go a
step further, and to crush the liberty of comment in
the press. Sir Robert made his own opportunity to
ensure the success of his preliminary step. Mr. Giffard,
of the theatre in Goodman’s Fields, waited on Sir
Robert in 1737 with the MS. of a piece named ‘The
Golden Rump,’ which had been sent to him, for performance,
by the anonymous author. Its spirit was so
licentiously manifested against the Ministry, and was
so revolutionary in its speech, suggestions, and principles,
that the prudent manager felt bound to place it
at the discretion of the minister. Sir Robert put it
in his pocket, went down to the House with it, and
ultimately succeeded, by its means, in carrying the
Licensing Act, by which the stage has been ever since
fettered. The anonymous piece brought by Giffard
was never acted, never printed, probably never seen by
anyone except manager and minister; and the question
remains,—Was it not written to order, to afford a
plausible pretext for protecting the administration
from all its antagonists? Chesterfield, in his speech in
the Lords against the proposed Act, denounced it as a
long stride towards the destruction of liberty itself.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
He declared that it would be made subservient to the
politics and schemes of the Court only. In the same
speech occurred the famous passage: ‘This Bill, my
Lords, is not only an encroachment upon Liberty, but
it is likewise an encroachment upon Property. Wit,
my Lords, is a sort of property. It is the property of
those who have it, and too often the only property
they have to depend on. It is indeed but a precarious
dependence. Thank God! we, my Lords, have a
dependence of another kind.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>FEAR OF THE PRETENDER.</i></div>

<p>In 1738, when the Opposition proposed a reduction
of the army, the Government manifested an almost
craven spirit. They believed that if the number of
armed men were diminished, the king would not be
secure from assault in St. James’s, nor the country safe
from foreign invasion.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>WALPOLE, ON JACOBITES.</i></div>

<p>In the Commons, Sir Robert Walpole spoke as
follows, on the Jacobites, their views, and their dealings
at that period:—‘There is one thing I am still
afraid of, and it is indeed I think the only thing at
present we have to fear. Whether it be proper to
mention it on this occasion, I do not know; I do not
know if I ought to mention it in such an Assembly as
this. I am sure there is no necessity for mentioning
it, because I am convinced that every gentleman that
hears me is as much afraid of it as I am. The fear I
mean is that of the Pretender. Everyone knows there
is still a Pretender to his Majesty’s crown and dignity.
There is still a person who pretends to be lawful
and rightful sovereign of these kingdoms; and what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
makes the misfortune much the more considerable,
there is still a great number of persons in these kingdoms
so deluded by his abettors, as to think in the
same way. These are the only persons who can properly
be called disaffected, and they are still so
numerous that though this government had not a
foreign enemy under the sun, the danger we are in
from the Pretender and the disaffected part of our own
subjects, is a danger which every true Briton ought to
fear; a danger which every man who has a due regard
for our present happy establishment, will certainly
endeavour to provide against as much as he can.</p>

<p>‘I am sorry to see, Sir, that this is a sort of fear
which many amongst us endeavour to turn into ridicule,
and for that purpose they tell us that though
there are many of our subjects discontented and
uneasy, there are very few disaffected; but I must beg
leave to be of a different opinion, for I believe that
most of the discontents and uneasinesses that appear
among the people proceed originally from disaffection.
No man of common prudence will profess himself
openly a Jacobite. By so doing he not only may
injure his private fortune, but he must render himself
less able to do any effectual service to the cause he
has embraced; therefore there are but few such men
in the kingdom. Your right Jacobite, Sir, disguises
his true sentiments. He roars out for Revolution
principles. He pretends to be a great friend of Liberty,
and a great adviser of our ancient Constitution; and
under this pretence there are numbers who every day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
endeavour to sow discontent among the people, by
persuading them that the constitution is in danger, and
that they are unnecessarily loaded with many and
heavy taxes. These men know that discontent and
disaffection are, like wit and madness, separated by
thin partitions, and therefore hope that if they can once
render the people thoroughly discontented, it will be
easy for them to render them disaffected. These are
the men we have the most reason to be afraid of.
They are, I am afraid, more numerous than most gentlemen
imagine; and I wish I could not say they have
been lately joined, and very much assisted, by some
gentlemen who, I am convinced, have always been,
and still are, very sincere and true friends to our happy
establishment.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CURIOUS DISCUSSION.</i></div>

<p>Walpole went on to say that he hoped Jacobitism
would die out. He was sure the Jacobites were daily
decreasing; but if such a mad step were taken as that
of reducing the army—‘I should expect to hear of the
Pretender’s standards being set up in several parts of
the island, perhaps in every part of the three kingdoms.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>SAFETY OF THE ROYAL FAMILY.</i></div>

<p>Wyndham ridiculed the idea that the army must
not be reduced, because ‘a certain gentleman was
afraid of the Pretender.’ Lord Polwarth (afterwards
Earl of Marchment) went further. He could scarcely
see the use of an army at all, and did not believe that
there were Jacobites to be afraid of. ‘I am sure his
Majesty, and all the rest of the Royal Family, might
remain in St. James’s Palace, or in any other part of
the kingdom, in the utmost safety, though neither of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
them had any such thing as that now called a soldier to
attend them. Of this now we have a glaring proof every
day before our eyes. His royal highness the Prince of
Wales has now no guards to attend him. He passes
every day to and fro in the streets of London, and
travels everywhere about London without so much as
one soldier to guard him. Nay, he has not so much as
one sentry upon his house in St. James’s Square, and
yet his Royal Highness lives, I believe, in as great
security, at his house in St. James’s Square, without
one sentry to guard him, as his Majesty can be supposed
to do in St. James’s Palace with all the guards
about him.’</p>

<p>The debate in the Lords was of much the same
quality as that in the Commons. Farewell to liberty if
there be a standing army. On the other side:—Freedom
will perish if the king cannot back his will by force
of bayonets. The Government, of course, succeeded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">‘<i>AGAMEMNON.</i>’</div>

<p>The debates encouraged the Jacobites to hope.
They were evidently feared, and opportunity might
yet serve them. The wise men at Westminster had
declared it. Meanwhile, the stage recommended them
to consider the difficulties of Government, and to
make the best of the one under which they lived.
Thomson put his tragedy ‘Agamemnon’ under the
protection of the Princess of Wales, trusting she would
‘condescend to accept of it.’ In the tragedy itself,
in which there is much blank verse that is only honest
prose in that aspiring form, there are few political
allusions; but the following passage was undoubtedly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
meant as incense for Cæsar, and instruction for his
people—Whigs and Jacobites.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>
</div>

<p><i>Ægisthus</i> answered with a slight rebuke to the
Jacobites who denounced the merits of all government
that had not their James <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> at its <span class="lock">head:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">Such is the nature of malignant man.</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE KING, IN PUBLIC.</i></div>

<p>Quin, as Agamemnon, rolled his measured lines out
with double emphasis, his anti-Stuart feelings adding
to the force. The ‘fierce oppositions’ of Ægisthus
were not to be found in factious shape, at least, in the
next session of Parliament. The debates at the opening
of the session had but the slightest touch of
Jacobitism in them; and that was in a speech by Lord
Gower,—whom Horace Walpole classed with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
Prince of Wales himself as a thorough Jacobite! Lord
Gower spoke ill of the ‘so-called’ King’s Speech as being
no royal speech at all, but one which conveyed the
dictates of the Ministry to the country. ‘The King,’
said Lord Gower, ‘has no more share in the councils
of the country than I have.’ A faint allusion in the
Commons to his Majesty and family being less popularly
esteemed than formerly, Mr. Lyttelton remarked:
‘I’ve repeatedly seen proofs to the contrary. In the
streets of London I’ve seen the people clinging to the
wheels of his coach, so as almost to impede it;’—and
the inference was that they would not have so affectionately
clung to the chariot-wheels of the Pretender.
Other proofs, during the session, were adduced of the
satisfactory condition of things. Recruiting for his
Majesty’s army was successfully going on in Scotland,
and the last cargo of old firelocks, resulting from the
disarming of the Highlanders, was just then being
landed at the Tower. Nevertheless, there were Jacobites
who were hoping for the best, and keeping their
powder dry.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>POLITICAL DRAMA.</i></div>

<p>Thomson made another effort in the year 1739 to
introduce politics on the stage. His ‘Edward and
Eleanora’ (after being publicly rehearsed) was advertised
for representation, on March 29th, at Covent Garden;
but, before the doors were open, the licenser withdrew
his permission, and prohibited the performance absolutely.
Thomson’s almost servile worship of the
reigning family was manifested in the dedication of
the tragedy to his patroness, the Princess of Wales.
‘In the character of Eleanora,’ he says, ‘I have endeavoured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
to represent, however faintly, a princess
distinguished for all the virtues that render greatness
amiable. I have aimed particularly to do justice to
her inviolable affection and generous tenderness for a
prince who was the darling of a great and free people.’
As Eleanora loved Edward, so, it was hinted, did
Augusta love Frederick!</p>

<p>Dr. Johnson could not see why this play was
‘obstructed.’ Genest could no more see the reason
than Dr. Johnson. Yet, the licenser may be easily
justified in withdrawing a license which should never
have been granted. The play touched nearly on the
dissensions between George <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> and his son Frederick,
who were then living in open hostility. Such passages
as the following would certainly have been hailed with
hilarious sarcasm by the Jacobites, who dwelt with
satisfaction on the unseemly antagonisms in the royal
<span class="lock">family:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Has not the royal heir a juster claim</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To share the Father’s inmost heart and Counsels,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Than aliens to his interest, those who make</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A property, a market, of his honour?</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The prince is urged to save the king from his
ministers; England is represented as in peril from
without as well as from within. Frederick, under the
name of Edward, is described as one who ‘loves the
people he must one day rule,’—Whigs and Jacobites
equally, <span class="lock">for:—</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>HENRY PELHAM AND THE JACOBITES.</i></div>

<p>When Henry <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> is declared to be dead, his son

<p>These domestic and political allusions pervade the
play. Its production would probably have led to riot,
and the Lord Chamberlain, or his deputy, did well in
prohibiting the play and thus keeping the peace.</p>

<p>In January, 1740, Mr. Sandys moved for leave to
bring in a Bill for the better securing the freedom of
Parliament, by limiting the number of Government
officers to sit in the House of Commons. Among the
opponents was Mr. Henry Pelham, who was convinced
that the Bill would help the Jacobites to carry out
their designs. ‘We know,’ he said, ‘how numerous
the disaffected still are in this kingdom; and they,
we may suppose, are not insensible to the prejudice
that has been done to their faction, by the places and
offices which are at the disposal of the crown. These
places and offices are of great use to the crown and,
I think, to the nation, in preventing gentlemen from
joining with a faction, or winning them away from it;
and the Jacobites are sensible they have lost many by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
this means, some, perhaps, after they had got a seat in
this House.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>JACOBITE PROSPECTS.</i></div>

<p>Mr. Pulteney, alluding to the assertion that if most
placemen were excluded from the House, there would
soon be a majority of Jacobites in it, said this was
supposing that there was a majority of Jacobites
among the people, a supposition which he denied, and
which he stigmatised as very uncomplimentary to the
king and his family. ‘But,’ he added, ‘if there should
once come to be a majority of placemen and officers
in this House, that majority would soon create a majority
of Jacobites in the nation.’ The consequences,
he was sure, would be an insurrection, the army
joining with the insurgents. This motion, in the
debate on which the Jacobites figured as both a
dangerous and a mercenary people, was lost by 222
to 206. Sixteen placemen saved Sir Robert, who had
spoken with much plausibility and cunning against the
leave asked for. The Bishop of Salisbury in the House
of Lords, in the discussion in March on the Pension
Bill, could only express a <em>hope</em> that faction would not
foster insurrection. The opposition papers maintained
that no such thing as faction existed, and that Jacobitism
was a name now utterly unknown to the mass
of the people. The opposition to Sir Robert was
increasing in strength, and this was taken to be a proof
that the Jacobites were increasing in number; but
everything was done to sustain the minister. ‘’Tis
observable,’ says the ‘Craftsman,’ ‘that St. Stephen’s
Chapel was never attended with more devotion than at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
present, the very lame and the blind hardly being
excused; and both Parties seeming to indicate by their
conduct that nobody knows what a day or an hour
may bring forth.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>DEATH OF WYNDHAM.</i></div>

<p>The opposition, rather than the Jacobite party,
experienced an immense loss this year, by the death of
Sir William Wyndham. This able man ceased to be
a Jacobite after he gave in his allegiance to the accomplished
fact of the established supremacy of the House
of Hanover. Wyndham became simply a ‘patriot,’
never ceasing his fierce, but polished, hostility to
Walpole, yet lending himself to no measure likely to
disturb the ‘happy establishment.’ Two years before
his death he took for second wife the widowed Marchioness
of Blandford, whose relatives opposed a
match with an ex-Jacobite. ‘She has done quite
right,’ said the old Dowager Duchess of Marlborough.
‘I’d have had him myself, if he’d only asked me sometime
ago!’</p>

<p>The camp pitched at Hounslow this year reminded
quidnuncs of the one formed by James <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>, to overawe
London. Londoners themselves expressed a hope that
the army would sweep ‘the infamous road’ of its
mounted highwaymen and its brutal footpads. But
by the presence of soldiers there was only an addition
to the number of robbers and of victims.</p>

Chevalier might cost a man his life, Walpole
made such a discovery in the person
of a friend of honest Shippen who, himself, kept up
such correspondence, but was successful in keeping it
concealed. Shippen went to the minister with an
urgent entreaty not to bring down destruction on his
friend. Mercy was a card it suited the minister to
play; he granted the prayer of his great political
opponent. But he suggested a stipulation. ‘I do
not ask you,’ said Sir Robert, ‘to vote against your
principles; but if questions should arise in the House,
personal to myself, do not then forget what I have
done for you to-day.’</p>

<p>A great personal question did arise,—this year.
Lord Carteret in the Lords, and Mr. Sandys, with his
long cravat of Queen Anne’s days, in the Commons,
moved, on the same day and in precisely the same
words, that the king should be requested to dismiss
Walpole from his service and counsels for ever. The
debate was hot in each House, and the object of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
movers was unsuccessful in both. In the Commons,
this incident occurred. The impetuous Jacobite
Shippen rose to speak. He certainly astonished the
House. The motion, he said, was merely made to put
out one minister, and to put in another. For his part,
he did not care who was in or who was out. He
would not vote at all. Shippen walked out of the
House, and he was followed by thirty-four friends
who had yielded to his persuasions. He thus proved
to Walpole the gratefulness of his memory.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>INCIDENTS IN PARLIAMENT.</i></div>

<p>This was not the only incident of the debate.
Mr. Edward Harley, uncle of the Earl of Oxford, was
one of the speakers. Walpole had borne hardly
against the earl as an enemy to the Protestant Succession,
for being which the peer had stood in some peril of
his life, and had temporarily lost his liberty. Mr. Harley
said, he would refrain from acting as unjustly to
Walpole, (against whom there was no specific charge,
only a general accusation, without any proofs,) as Walpole
had acted against his nephew on mere suspicion;—and
Mr. Harley walked out of the House, without
voting.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>PARTY CHARACTERISTICS.</i></div>

<p>Walpole said of members of Parliament,—he would
not declare who was corrupt, but that Shippen was
incorruptible. Coxe, in his Life of the Minister, does
not describe Shippen as a ‘Hanover Tory,’ running
with the hare and holding with the hounds, of whom
there were many, but as an uncompromising Jacobite,
one who repeated among his Whig friends that there
would be neither peace nor content till the Stuarts were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
restored; and who confessed to his confidants, that
there were occasions on which he never voted in the
House till he had received orders from Rome;—that
is, not from Innocent, Benedict, or Clement, but from
King James <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> Shippen used to say of Walpole and
himself, ‘Robin and I understand each other. He is
for King George, I am for King James; but those
men with the long cravats, Sandys, Rushout, Gybbon,
and others, only want places, and they do not care
under which King they hold them.’ This corresponds
with John, Lord Harvey’s, account of parties under
George <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> The Whigs were divided into patriots and
courtiers, or Whigs out, and Whigs in; the Tories
into Jacobites and Hanover Tories,—the first ‘thorough,’
the second joining with their opponents when there
was a promise of profit, personal or political. But
their prayer was something like that of the half-starved
Highland chieftain: ‘Lord, turn the world
upside down, that honest men may make bread of it!’</p>

<p>At this time, there was much reiteration of the
assurance of Jacobitism being either dead or in
despair. As a proof of the contrary, on May 19th,
the London ‘Champion’ referred to movements in
the Chevalier’s court at Rome. He had held several
meetings with Ecclesiastics, and also with laymen,
‘well-wishers to his interests.’ The ‘Champion’ could
not explain the meaning of these two extraordinary
assemblies, but attributed them to letters received from
London.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ON HOUNSLOW HEATH.</i></div>

<p>The ‘Gentlemen of the Road,’ loyal robbers as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
they were, were despatched at Tyburn, in spite of their
Hanoverian principles. Those principles were manifested
by a couple of highwaymen who stopped a
carriage on Hounslow Heath, the inmates of which,
four young children and two ladies, were on the way
from Epsom to Cliefden. The highwaymen were informed
that the children were Prince George, Princess
Augusta, and a younger prince and princess. The
Whig highwaymen hoped God would bless them all,
and they rode off towards another carriage coming up
at a little distance. This carriage was filled with
nurses and servants of the royal children; and the
robbers stripped them of every article of value which
they carried with them. The singularity of this illustration
of the times consists in this,—that at a
period when robbers abounded, and that more highwaymen
were to be found on Hounslow Heath than
elsewhere, the young members of the royal family
were sent across that dangerous heath without any
protecting escort.</p>

<p>At the court of the Prince of Wales in London,
an incident, not without a certain significance, occurred.
The Marquis of Caernarvon presented Mr. Chandler,
‘the bookseller, outside Temple Bar,’ to the prince.
The worthy bookseller handed to the Heir Apparent
three volumes of what may be almost called ‘forbidden
fruit,’ namely ‘Reports of Parliamentary Debates,
from the accession of George <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>,’—an instalment
of a great collection to be afterwards completed.
They were dedicated to the prince by his permission,—a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
condescension which, no doubt, was suspected of
being tainted by Jacobitism. An incident of another
description may have gratified a rancorous Jacobite or
two. The Jenny Diver who, in her youth, had nearly
stolen Atterbury’s ring from his finger, as she kissed
his hand, came now, in maturer years, to the end of
her career at Tyburn. With nineteen others of both
sexes, she journeyed to the gallows. The nineteen
were divided into half a dozen carts, but Hanoverian
Jenny went in a mourning coach accompanied by a
chaplain, and escorted by four soldiers of the footguards.
An hour later, a ghastly equality shrouded
the whole of the strangled score.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>TORIES NOT JACOBITES.</i></div>

<p>Although men’s minds were chiefly occupied in
1742 with the withdrawal of Walpole from office and
public life, and the Chevalier and his projects seemed
well-nigh forgotten, these projects were kept in view
by public men. Pulteney said in the House that he
had himself told the king, the Tories were not universally
Jacobites, but that, treating them as if they
were, would certainly make them so. Aye, rejoined
Sir Everard Digby, just as in Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>’s time, the
advisers of arbitrary measures against the Puritans
only increased the numbers of those people. Fear of
the designs of the Jacobite faction led to an application
to the Commons for a money grant in aid of the
bringing over certain bodies of troops in Ireland, to
England. It was in the course of this debate that
Winnington described the exact position of Jacobites
and Jacobitism, at the moment he was <span class="lock">speaking:—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CONDITION OF PARTIES.</i></div>

<p>‘There are still many gentlemen of figure and
fortune among us who openly profess their attachment
to the Pretender. There is a sort of enthusiastic
spirit of disaffection that still prevails among the
vulgar; and there is too great a number of men of all
ranks and conditions who now seem to be true friends
to the Protestant Succession who would declare themselves
otherwise, if they thought they could do so
without running any great or unequal risk. These
considerations shall always make me jealous of the
Jacobite party’s getting any opportunity to rebel, and
this they have always thought they had, and always
will think they have, when they see the nation destitute
of troops, for which reason, I shall always be for
keeping in the island such a number of regular troops
as may be sufficient for awing them into obedience....
The danger of an invasion from abroad, with the
Pretender at the head of it, is equally to be apprehended.’
Alluding to Spain with whom we were at
war, Mr. Winnington said: ‘She will use every art
that can be thought of for throwing into this island 8
or 10,000 men of her best troops, with the Pretender
and some of his adherents at their head.’ Mr. Carew
believed that there were very few men in England
who would join the Pretender, if he invaded it, and
that in such case he would speedily be overwhelmed.
The motion was, however, successful by 280 to 269.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>IN LEICESTER FIELDS.</i></div>

<p>The popularity of the Prince of Wales was manifested
in a singular way this year. It was known that
he was about to take up his residence in Leicester<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
Fields. The place was in some degree beautified for
the occasion, and the grass in the centre was enclosed
by a neat wooden railing. On the first night of the
arrival of the Prince and his family, the congratulating
mob pulled down the rails, piled them up in front of
Leicester House, and kindled a bonfire which nearly
ignited the doors of the mansion. The Prince, however,
sent out his thanks to the mob for their civility,
and he promised to adorn the enclosure with a statue
of the king his father—a promise which he failed to
keep, and probably never meant to do so. A statue
of George <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>, brought from Canons, the seat of the
Duke of Chandos, was put up there in 1748.</p>

<p>The new sect of Methodists was now creating suspicion.
Some friends of the Happy Establishment
looked upon them with even more aversion than they
bestowed on the Jacobites. At the execution of two
criminals, the Prince of Wales sent one of his chaplains
(Mr. Howard) to afford them spiritual comfort.
But, they were also attended by a Mr. Simms, who,
says the ‘Whitehall Evening Post,’ ‘was formerly a
butcher, but lately a strict follower of the modern
Methodists.’ The orthodox ‘Post’ adds:—‘By the
Influence of whose Doctrine these hardened Wretches
were brought to Penitence, we need not point out to
our Readers.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>AWAKING OF JACOBITES.</i></div>

<p>It would seem that the term ‘Prime Minister’ was
first applied to Walpole, and in a reproachful sense.
Speaking in the House, in 1741, he said of his opponents:
‘Having invested me with a kind of mock<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
dignity, and styled me a <em>Prime Minister</em>, they impute
to me an unpardonable abuse of that chimerical
authority, which only they created and conferred.’
Under the Earl of Wilmington as First Lord of the
Treasury the better times, foretold by the ex-Prime
Minister’s enemies, failed to come to pass. Meanwhile,
every significant incident in Parliament, every detail of
the domestic life of the king, was regularly transmitted
from London to the Chevalier, at Rome. One of the
Parliamentary incidents of the year was the appointment
of the Duke of Argyle to the offices of Master-General
of the Ordnance, and Commander-in-chief of
the Forces, offices which he resigned, a month later,
because of the exclusion of Tories from power, but
especially because of the refusal to admit the Jacobite,
Sir John Hynde Cotton, to a place in the Government.
‘The Pretender and all that set,’ wrote Mann, at
Florence, to Horace Walpole, ‘are in high spirits and
flatter themselves more than ever. I don’t know but
they have reason. I confess to you I should be very
sorry to see the Duke of Argyle with an army; then,
might the Pretender, in my opinion, triumph.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CHESTERFIELD’S OPINIONS.</i></div>

<p>The Jacobites found, perhaps, unconscious supporters
of their cause in the writers who energetically
denounced the reigning monarch’s partiality for Hanover,
at the cost of England. Atterbury himself could
not have turned this subject more profitably to the
cause of the Chevalier than Chesterfield did in the
first number of ‘Old England’ (<abbr title="February">Feb.</abbr> 5th, 1743):—‘I am
entirely persuaded that in the words, “<em>our present happy</em><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
<em>establishment</em>,” the happiness meant there is that of
the subjects; and that if the “establishment” should
make the Prince happy, and the subjects otherwise, it
would be very justly termed “<em>our present unhappy
establishment</em>.” I apprehend the nation did not think
James unworthy of the Crown, merely that he might
make way for the Prince of Orange; nor can I conceive
that they ever precluded themselves from dealing
by King William in the same manner as they had
done by King James, if he had done as much to deserve
such a treatment. Neither can I in all my search
find that when the Crown was settled in an hereditary
line upon the present Royal Family, the people of
Great Britain ever signed any formal instrument of
recantation by which they expressed their sorrow and
repentance of what they had done against King James,
and protested that they would never do so by any
future Prince, though reduced to the same melancholy
necessity.’ The ‘sacred right of insurrection’ was
here maintained, as fully as any Jacobite could have
maintained it, against a family whose possession of the
Crown of England was not by right of blood, but
because the nation ‘which gave the crown looked for the
greatest amount of happiness from the recipients.’ In
a subsequent number Chesterfield somewhat modified
this tone, but without mutilating its sense. If he spoke
treason, he said it should be treason within the law.
He was loyal to the reigning family because he thought
he could live free under it, and hoped that ‘we are
<em>determined</em> to live free.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>KING AND ELECTOR.</i></div>

<p>Lord Chesterfield spoke in similar sense and spirit
in the various fiery debates upon keeping Hanoverian
troops in British pay, and <em>that</em> for Hanoverian interests
solely, to further which the British people were taxed.
It was even doubted whether the Elector of Hanover
had any right to appear at the head of a British army,
where such interests alone were concerned. Mr.
Murray (afterwards Lord Mansfield) in the Commons
denounced such sentiments as republican and Jacobitical.
Lord Chesterfield, in a later discussion in the Lords,
said: ‘It is said of a noble Lord in a late reign, that
he turned Roman Catholic in order to overrule a Roman
Catholic king then upon our throne. I hope we
have not at present any reason to suspect that any
British subject is now with the same view turned
Hanoverian. But as such a thing is possible, as wolves
sometimes appear “in sheeps” clothing, those who are
truly jealous of our present happy establishment will
always have a jealousy of a British Minister that savours
too strong of the Hanoverian.’</p>

<p>A most unpleasant incident of the year was connected
with two anonymous letters addressed to the
Speaker of the House of Commons and Lord Carteret, in
which the writer, ‘Wat Tyler,’ informed them that if the
latter brought in Hanoverian troops that winter, there
were two hundred men bound by oath who would tear
him, and all who voted with him, limb from limb. The
most significant incident of all, however, remains to be
told.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>HIGHLAND REGIMENT IN LONDON.</i></div>

<p>Early after the Jacobite rebellion of 1715, a force<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
consisting of six companies of Highlanders was formed,
for the purpose of causing the peace to be kept in the
northern portion of Scotland. In 1739, this force,
known as the Black Watch, was embodied as a regiment,
which, from its commander, was named ‘Lord Sempill’s.’
An idea prevailed among the men that they
were embodied for home service only. In 1743
the regiment was ordered to London, for the purpose
of joining the actively employed British army. The
scene of this actively employed army was then in Germany.
Sempill’s regiment marched to London with
unconcealed aversion. They were in some degree
calmed by assurances from their officers that the march
to London was in order that the king might gratify
his royal wish to review the regiment in person. Their
pride was gratified; they reached Highgate in good
order, and they were there encamped. The camp was
visited by thousands of Londoners, who praised the
good discipline and quiet disposition of the Highlanders.
Among the most assiduous, insinuating, and seductive
of the visitors were the London Jacobites. When the
men heard that the king had left London for his army
on the Continent, and that they were under orders to
follow, their pride was wounded; and the Jacobites
took care to inflame the wound and aggravate both the
alleged slight and the anger of the offended soldiery.
A review of Sempill’s regiment on the king’s birthday,
14th May 1743, by General Wade, on Finchley Common,
was more gratifying to the spectators than to the
men. The papers describe the Highlanders as making<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
‘a very handsome appearance. They went through
their exercises and firing with the utmost exactness.
The novelty of the sight drew together the greatest
concourse of people ever seen on such an occasion.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>DESERTION OF THE MEN.</i></div>

<p>Four days later, orders came for the troops to
embark on the Thames. On that day about a hundred
and fifty of the men failed to answer the morning roll call.
They had not only disappeared, but with them
their arms and several rounds of ball cartridge. ‘They
did not care to go,’ says Walpole, in one of his May
letters, ‘where it would not be equivocal for what
King they fought.’ Sir Robert Munro, their Lieutenant-Colonel,
before their leaving Scotland, asked some of
the Ministry, ‘But suppose there should be any rebellion
in Scotland, what should we do for these eight
hundred men?’ It was answered, ‘Why, there would
be eight hundred fewer rebels there!’ They were
evidently mistrusted. The deserters, who justified the
mistrust, had conceived that the review, for which they
had marched to London, being over, they had a right
to march back again. They concerted together, kept
their own secret, were not betrayed by comrades who
looked upon their military duty in another light, and
they quietly left the camp at Highgate in the dead of
night. They were under the command of a fine stalwart
corporal named Macpherson, the corporal’s
brother, and an intelligent private, Shaw. For what
purpose they set out for <a id="chg2"></a>Scotland was probably best
known by the Jacobites of the metropolis. The object
must have been far more serious than simply to return,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
because they conceived such action was within the
limits of their legal right. This would have been the
wildest folly, and the Macphersons and their men were
neither fools nor savages.
<span class="sni"><i>MARCH OF THE DESERTERS.</i></span>
However this may be, London
was in uncontrollable alarm, and expected a record
of plunder, murder, and incendiarism along the line
of march, till the retreat was stopped and the deserters
captured. On the contrary, the Highlanders, as they
proceeded northward, injured neither man, woman, nor
child—neither in person nor property. The most active
measures were taken to pursue, meet, envelope, and
destroy this most disloyal and yet much admired body.
They were heard of everywhere; were scarcely seen
anywhere. The reward for catching a single straggler
was forty shillings; but there were no stragglers. The
men understood the uses of solidarity, and kept compact
in body as they were united in sentiment. Corporal
Macpherson seemed to know the country perfectly,
and to have a map of it ever under his eyes.
Infantry, cavalry, volunteer mobs, and posses of constables
scoured the districts on the line of march, but
could not meet with those who were nearly successfully
accomplishing this Xenophonian retreat. Macpherson,
in fact, constantly changed his line. He led his men
across country by night, always encamping in woods,
by day, behind hastily constructed defences. Sometimes
they made rapid marches by day, and took food
and repose at night.
<span class="sni"><i>THE HIGHLANDERS AT OUNDLE.</i></span>
On the morning of the 22nd, a
Mr. Justice Creed heard of them as being encamped
near his residence, about four miles from Oundle, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
Northamptonshire. Like a brave and good man, he
went down to them and got permission to address the
famished and foot-sore band. He did this with such
effect, as to obtain from them a sacred promise to surrender
on condition of receiving a general pardon. Creed
wrote in camp a letter to that effect to the Duke of
Montagu, Master of the Ordnance. Macpherson undertook
that the Highlanders should remain in their quarters
till an answer was received. In the meantime, a
Captain Ball, who had been despatched by General
Blakeney with a force of cavalry from the northeastern
district to intercept the march of the Highlanders,
came upon them near Oundle, and demanded
their immediate and unconditional surrender. The
parties interchanged civilities. Macpherson informed
the Captain that, through Creed, they were in negotiation
with the Government. The Corporal also found
means to let Creed know the exact state of affairs.
The Justice advised them to surrender and hope for the
best. Macpherson then invited the Captain to come
and look at his entrenched position in the wood, as
authorising him to hold out, and to defy any attack
from Ball’s cavalry. The Captain confessed that they
were unassailable by cavalry. Then, said the Corporal,
here we will die like men, our arms in our hands. The
Captain intimated that if they did not surrender, not a
man should leave the place alive. Two of the Highlanders
escorted Ball to the edge of the wood; but on
the way he convinced both that the only thing left for
them was to return unarmed to their regiment. One<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
of these two remained with the persuasive cavalry
officer. The other returned to the little fortress in the
wood, where he laid before the corporal commander-in-chief
and the body of Highlanders the Captain’s arguments
and conclusions.
<span class="sni"><i>MILITARY EXECUTION.</i></span>
This he did with such effect
that the body of fugitives surrendered unconditionally
to General Blakeney, who disarmed them and sent
them, as captured deserters, to their old quarters at
Highgate. London literally ‘turned out,’ to see them
subsequently marched down to the Tower. Their
uniforms were torn, and each man was tightly pinioned;
but their bearing was so becoming that no voice insulted
them. Their manliness was worthy of respect,
and their offence was deserving of the issue which
followed on the parade ground of the Tower. Justice
was satisfied with the sacrifice of three victims. On
the 22nd of July, the whole regiment was drawn out
semi-circular on the ground. Some paces in front stood
three groups of soldiers with loaded muskets—the
firing parties. Presently Macpherson, his brother, and
Shaw walked up, without fear or ostentation, but with
great gravity, to places face to face with those comrades
who had been told off for their swift destruction. As
the three men were seen to kneel in prayer, the whole
regiment simultaneously, unordered, followed the example,
and prayed for their countrymen. After a brief
silence, the doomed three stood firmly upright. A
rattle of musketry from the respective firing parties
rolled over the ground; and a minute or two later a
few clansmen of the Macphersons and comrades of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
Shaw reverently covered their bodies, and removed
them for interment near the spot where they had
perished.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THREATENED INVASION.</i></div>

<p>The incident was not altogether apart from Jacobitism;
nor probably was the subsequent fact, namely,
that Lord John Murray, who afterwards was Colonel of
the regiment, had the portraits of these three men hung
up in his dining-room. The year closed with a threatening
incident. Charles Edward left Rome in December
for France, in order to accompany the expedition
which was preparing in French ports for the invasion
of England, under Marshal Saxe. There can be little
doubt that the Government was well informed of the
good intentions of France, by trustworthy agents abroad.</p>

<p>There is a tradition, however, that the first intelligence
of a plot to restore the Stuarts was sent up to
London from the Post office at Bath. Ralph Allen (the
<em>Squire Allworthy</em> of Fielding’s ‘Tom Jones’) had, since
the year 1720, enjoyed a grant, or farm, of all the
bye-way or cross-road letters in England and Wales,
which grant he possessed till his death, in 1764. It is
said that this Ralph Allen, of Prior Park, owed much
of his large fortune to the result of his practice of
opening letters; and it is added that by opening one
of these cross-road letters he gained information of a
plot for the Jacobite invasion of England,—and this
information being sent to London, gave to its inhabitants
the first announcement of an impending rebellion.
In this same month of December, as was afterwards
made known, a packet passed through the post,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
addressed to Simon, Lord Fraser of Lovat, hitherto a
supposed friend of the Hanoverian dynasty. It contained
matter which helped him to the scaffold on Tower
Hill,—namely, his appointment to an important command
in the Jacobite army about to be organised, and
a flattering allusion to Lovat’s worthiness to wear a
ducal title. Walpole was entitled to say, as he did:—‘We
are in more confusion than we care to own.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CONFUSION.</i></div>

<p>There was mirth enough in the opposition papers.
Their columns crackled with epigrams against the king,
court, and the Countess of Yarmouth. They were but
slightly veiled and were still less slightly pointed.
There was some regret perhaps that the reward offered
by De Noailles, at Dettingen, to the troops that should
capture George <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>, in that battle, had only resulted in
the utter cutting to pieces of the Black Mousquetaires,
who made the attempt.</p>

<p>It was on the 15th of February, 1744, after there
had been some difficulty to persuade people of the
impending danger, that the king informed Parliament
and the nation, that this kingdom was about to be
invaded by the French, with the design of overthrowing
the present happy establishment, and the Protestant
succession, and of restoring the Stuarts and the Romish
religion. In the debates which ensued in both Houses,
all the occasional references to Jacobites seemed to
have come together in one heap. Lord Orford (Walpole)
reminded the peers how he had been calumniated and
ridiculed for repeating that the Jacobites had never
ceased to plot, and that they would one day renew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
their attempt to destroy the present dynasty.
<span class="sni"><i>PREPARATIONS.</i></span> If England
was not ready to meet this attempt, the fault
would be with those who were now in power. Lord
Chesterfield still maintained that the Jacobites in the
metropolis were few, and that hostility to the Government
was chiefly maintained there by the malicious
and contemptible sect of Nonjurors. One Jacobite
member in the Commons, Sir Francis Dashwood, was
audacious, at least by inuendoes. Alluding to the
harsh epithets flung at the Chevalier, he remarked that
James <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> had branded as an invader and usurper that
William of Orange, who was afterwards hailed by the
country as its glorious deliverer. He referred also to
the incident in Roman history of the Roman soldiers
refusing to march against foreign invaders till they had
destroyed the tyranny which reigned at Rome. The
application of these remarks was easy enough. They
showed the spirit of the Jacobite party, particularly in
London. The natural result ensued, namely, a proclamation
to the justices to put in force the laws which
had been framed against Papists and Nonjurors. The
former were ordered to remove to a distance of at least
ten miles from the metropolis, or to keep close within
their habitations. Those persons who refused to take
the oaths of allegiance and abjuration were to be
deprived of their arms and horses; and every attempt
at rioting was to be put down by armed force.
Further, every person found corresponding with the
Pretender or his sons were pronounced to be guilty of
High Treason,—which involved forfeiture of life, title,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
and estates. If this seems stringent, it must be
remembered that already had there been caught and
caged in Newgate a Popish priest, who, putting in action
the teaching of his Church that it only interfered with
religion,—and with morals, which means everything
else,—had, in the disguise of an imaginary captainship,
been trying to enlist men into the service of the
enemy.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>DECLARATION OF WAR.</i></div>

<p>Then came the mutual declarations of war. That
of France against England accused the latter power of
every political enormity. That of England against
France was equally explicit,—with the special addition
that France had treacherously assisted Spain against
England, when France was openly at peace with England,
and that it was now aiding and abetting the
Pretender who, through his son, was preparing to overthrow
the royal family, government, and constitution
of Great Britain.</p>

<p>What was the temper of the nation with regard to
the present condition of things?</p>

<p>No doubt there was some satisfaction felt by the
Jacobite guests over their cups at the ‘Mourning
Bush’ in Aldersgate Street. This sign was originally
set up in London by Taylor, the Water Poet, at his
tavern in Phœnix Alley, Long Acre, as a token of his
principles, after the death of Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> He was however
compelled to take it down. Another adherent
of the Stuarts, Rawlinson, who kept the ‘Mitre’ in
Fenchurch Street, put it in mourning, as a testimony of
similar opinions. Jacobite Hearne thought the ‘Mourning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
Mitre’ very appropriate. ‘Rawlinson certainly
did right. The honour of the mitre was much eclipsed
through the loss of so good a parent of the Church of
England. Those rogues say, this endeared him so
much to the churchmen, that he soon throve amain
and got a good estate.’ It is not to be supposed that
the ‘Bush’ in Aldersgate Street was actually craped,
or sable-framed, in 1744; but the tradition was kept
up that the ‘Bush’ <em>was</em> in mourning, and would continue
to be so, till the Stuarts were restored.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>LETTER FROM HURD.</i></div>

<p>Among the persons, on the other hand, who looked
upon the threatened coming of Prince Charles Edward
as hardly amounting to a bad dream was Mr. Hurd,—subsequently
a bishop, but in February, 1744, at
Cambridge, looking forward to receive priests orders
in May at the hands of Dr. Gooch, Bishop of Norwich,
in the chapel of Caius College. The news from London
was exciting, and Hurd writes to his friend, the
Rev. John Devey, on the 17th of February:—‘Nothing
is talked of here but an invasion from the French.
The Chevalier is at Paris, and we are to expect him
here in a short time. Whatever there may be in this
news, it seems to have consternated the Ministry. The
Tower is trebly guarded, and so is St. James’s, and the
soldiers have orders to be ready for action at an hour’s
warning. They are hasting, it seems, from all quarters
of the kingdom to London. I saw a regiment
yesterday, going through Newmarket. After all, I
apprehend very little from this terror. It seems a
polite contrivance of the French to give a diversion to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
our men, and keep the English out of Germany. Let
me know what is said in your part of the world.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>PUBLIC FEELING.</i></div>

<p>Lady Sarah Cowper (in the Correspondence of
Mrs. Delany) writes:—‘If it is true that the French
design only to draw our troops from Flanders, and
facilitate their own conquests abroad, and that the
Kingdom of England and our present government may
however be safe, I am sure at least that the unhappy
wretches already drawn into rebellion, and more that
may follow their example, must be sufferers. The
distress must fall somewhere, and all humane people
must have some share in it.’</p>

<p>Again, some idea of the half-frightened, half-jocular
feeling of persons in humbler life (as to invasion) may
be gathered from a letter in the same Correspondence
(ii. 384), written from Fulham, by a waiting gentlewoman
in the service of Mrs. Donnellan, to a friend in
the country:—‘I really believe in my heart, Master do
not care if the French comes and eats us all up alive. Is
there not flat boats, I know not how many thousands,
ready to come every day? and when they once set
out, they will be with us as quick as a swallow can fly,
almost; and when they land we have no body to fight
them, because you will not raise your militia. For my
part, I dare not go to the Thames, for fear they should
be coming; and if I see one of our own boats laden
with carrots, I am ready to drop down thinking it one
of the French.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>LADY M. W. MONTAGUE.</i></div>

<p>How difficult it was for English subjects in France
to send news to London is exemplified in a letter,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
written in March, 1744, by Lady Mary Wortley
Montague, at Avignon, to her husband, of an interview
with the Duke de Richelieu. The latter asked her, ‘What
party the Pretender had in England?’ ‘I answered,’
she writes, ‘as I thought, a very small one.’ ‘We are
told otherwise at Paris,’ said he; ‘however a bustle at
this time may serve to facilitate our other projects,
and we intend to attempt a descent; at least, it will
cause the troops to be recalled, and perhaps Admiral
Mathews will be obliged to leave the passage open for
Don Philip.’ The lady thus continues: ‘You may
imagine how much I wished to give you immediate
notice of this; but as all the letters are opened at
Paris, it would have been to no purpose to write it by
post, and have only gained me a powerful enemy in
the Court of France. In my letter to Sir Robert
Walpole, from Venice, I offered my service, and desired
to know in what manner I could send intelligence, if
anything happened to my knowledge that could be of
use to England. I believe he imagined that I wanted
some gratification, and he only returned me cold
thanks.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CARTE, THE NONJUROR.</i></div>

<p>‘Nobody is yet taken up: God knows why not!’
Such is the exclamation of Horace Walpole in a letter
to Mann, on the 23rd of February, this year. Government,
however, soon began the system of arrest.
Colonel Cecil, supposed to be designed for the Chevalier’s
Secretary of State, was captured. Papers which
were found upon him compromised Lord Barrymore,
the Pretender’s general, who, before day-break on a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
March morning, was arrested by a file of soldiers at
his house in Henrietta Street, Cavendish Square.
Cecil had previously removed his papers out of harm’s
way; but, thinking the danger over, he had resumed
possession of them. ‘These discoveries,’ says Horace
Walpole, ‘go on but lamely. One may perceive who
is <em>not</em> Minister, rather than who is.’ The notorious
Carte, who had been taken up under a suspension of
the Habeas Corpus Act, was carried before the Duke of
Newcastle. ‘Are you a bishop?’ asked the duke,
thinking he might be a Nonjuring prelate. ‘No, my
lord duke,’ replied the Nonjuror; ‘there are no bishops
in England but what are of your Grace’s own making;
and I am sure I have no reason to expect that honour.’
After he was set at liberty, the saucy ‘Westminster
Journal’ remarked: ‘Mr. Carte was confined for he
knew not what; and discharged for he knew not
why.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CARTE’S HISTORY OF ENGLAND.</i></div>

<p>Carte, the biographer of Ormond, and the ex-secretary
of Atterbury, was a man who had twice fled
abroad when accounted a rebel, and who was allowed
to return when he was thought to be harmless. He,
this year, issued a prospectus of his intended History of
England. The London municipality met the overture
in a liberal spirit which did it honour, but which
brought upon it the bitterest sarcasm of Horace Walpole.
‘I wish to God,’ he wrote in his anger to Mann,
from Arlington Street, in July, 1744, ‘I wish to God
Boccalini was living! Never was such an opportunity
for Apollo’s playing off a set of fools as there is now!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
The good City of London, who, from long dictating to
the Government, are now come to preside over taste
and letters, having given one Carte, a Jacobite parson,
fifty pounds a year, for seven years, to write the History
of England; and four aldermen and six common-councilmen
are to inspect his materials and the progress
of the work. Surveyors of common-sewers turned
supervisors of literature! To be sure, they think a
History of England is no more than Stowe’s survey of
the parishes! Instead of having books printed with
the <i lang="fr">imprimatur</i> of an university, they will be printed,
as churches are whitewashed, John Smith and Thomas
Johnson, Churchwardens!’ Such was the light spirit
with which the fine gentleman of Strawberry visited the
first step taken by the London Corporation, in imitation
of the ancient foreign guilds, to do honour to literature
and literary men. In Carte’s case, politics were not
considered. The Jacobite had given proof of his
ability, and the Whigs trusted to his honesty. If his
discretion had been equal to both, his History would
have been more acceptable to the City companies.
This Nonjuror died in 1754.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>VARIOUS INCIDENTS.</i></div>

<p>Walpole had looked for a landing of the French
and the Pretender, in Essex or Suffolk. He thought the
English crown would be fought for, not on the seas
but on land, and he declared that he never knew how
little he was a Jacobite till it was almost his interest to
be one. The interest changed as London was secured
and our preparations were more successfully made than
those of France. In March, he was sure, ‘if they still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
attempt the invasion, there will be a bloody war.’
The spirit of the nation was sound. As troops marched
towards London, they were fed and cherished on the
way as the defenders of England from Popery and the
French. The London merchants were equally spirited.
The name of the French was injurious to the Chevalier’s
cause; and the fear of Popery was not abolished by
the assurances of the Jacobites that the young Chevalier
was a Lutheran. One of the curious features of the
time was connected with the Swiss servants in London,
who formed themselves into a volunteer regiment, and
placed themselves at the disposal of the Government.
The warlike appearances subsided a little when tempests
broke up the naval preparations at Dunkirk,
and drove the Brest squadron from the Channel.
The Jacobite interest, however, was maintained in
some of the counties. Walpole, in allusion to the
changes in the Ministry at the end of the year (when
Carteret and Lord Granville withdrew), says that
several Tories refused to accept proffered posts from
an impossibility of being re-chosen for their Jacobite
counties. <em>One</em> at least may be excepted. Sir John
Cotton was forced upon the king as Treasurer of the
Chambers. The king was naturally displeased that
an adherent of the Stuarts should be thrust into an
office in the royal household at St. James’s. The
matter was illustrated by a caricature, in which the
Falstaffian Sir John was being thrust down his majesty’s
throat by the united endeavours of the Ministry—the
‘Broad-bottom,’—a coalition of men of opposite parties,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
which therefore gave a tameness to most of the
debates.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>LADY NITHSDALE.</i></div>

<p>In the spring of this year died, in Rome, the only
contemptible Jacobite peer who had been condemned
to death; and he had had the good luck to escape,—the
Earl of Nithsdale. He was taken into the Chevalier’s
service, but for more than a quarter of a century, he
looked to his heroic wife for money; and was neither
satisfied nor grateful. He was unreasonably querulous,
never had brains enough to be conscious of what his
wife had risked and had done for him; was mean and
untruthful; ever and utterly unworthy of this brave,
noble, and true-hearted woman. Even after her husband’s
death she saved his honour by paying his debts,
as she had before saved his life. When she too passed
away, in 1749, there could not have been a Jacobite
who read the record of her death in the London papers,
nor any <em>man</em>, however he might have hated the Stuarts
and their church, but would have acknowledged that no
truer martyr ever died at Rome than this angelic
daughter of the house of Herbert.</p>

<p class="drop-img unindent"><span class="drop-img"><img alt="t" src="images/drop_t_a.jpg" width="75"></span>
<span class="smcap">he</span> stage took an early opportunity to put
forth utterances in behalf of ‘moral order.’
On March 18th, 1745, Thomson, as warm
a Hanoverian as could be found among
Scots, produced his tragedy—‘Tancred and Sigismunda,’
at Drury Lane. The piece was ostentatiously
patronised by Frederick, Prince of Wales, to whom
the poet subsequently dedicated it, as a liberal patron
of all arts, but particularly of dramatic art. Pitt and
Lyttelton were present at a private reading of the play,
which, therefore, had a certain political significance,
and Whigs and Jacobites sat in judgment on it.
Thomson’s cunning, however, enabled him to please
both parties. When <em>Siffredi</em> (Sheridan) uttered the
lines, referring to a deceased <span class="lock">king,—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span></p>
<p class="unindent">the applause which followed had a divided, or a
double, application; but it was as nothing to the
tumult of approbation which greeted the passage emphasised
by <em>Tancred</em> <span class="lock">(Garrick):—</span></p>

<p>And again had thundering acclamation double-meaning

</div>
</div>

<p>When the first act ended, the factions of Jacobites
and Hanoverians were equally satisfied with
their power of making political use of passages in this
play.</p>

<p>They found few opportunities in the second act;
but both parties clapped hands at the lines of

<p>During the remainder of the tragedy the love-woes
of <em>Tancred</em>, and <em>Sigismunda</em> absorbed the sympathies
of the audience, though Thomson laid a clap-trap or
two, in a passage where mention was made of ‘a faithless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>

Normans who bravely won,</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">By the same noble tenure;</div>

<p class="unindent">but especially in denouncement of a reign which
Osmond stigmatised as a usurpation; and <span class="lock">added—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">This meteor King may blaze awhile, but soon</div>

</div>

<p class="unindent">which usurpation Jacobites would assign to George;
while Whigs saw in the temporary royal meteor the
‘King’ in whose name, his son, Charles Edward, was
preparing to invade Great Britain.</p>

<p>The Earl of Orford, the champion of Brunswick
and the staunch supporter of the Hanoverian succession,
died this year. Horace Walpole says of his
father, ‘he died, foretelling a Rebellion which happened
in less than six months, and for predicting which
he had been ridiculed.’ It required no gift of prophecy
to foretell an event which had been long almost
openly preparing.</p>

<p>Amid the growing excitement of London, there was
a motion made by Mr. Carew in the Commons, for holding
new parliaments annually. He supported the motion
by a curious illustration. The king, he said, who first
introduced long parliaments (Richard <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>) was dethroned
and put to death by Henry of Lancaster, who took his
place and was honoured by the people as their deliverer
from slavery. Sir William Yonge replied that
annual parliaments would deprive the king of all
power over them; and deprivation of all such power<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
cost Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> his head. Similar effect would follow
from like cause. Sir John Phillips, who was said to
be equally troublesome whether as patriot or placeman,
was not only for annual parliaments, but for a
fresh Ministry every new session! The motion was
negatived by 145 to 112.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE YOUNG CHEVALIER.</i></div>

<p>After the prorogation of Parliament which followed
in May, the king went abroad. He did not return till
the end of July, more than a fortnight after the young
Chevalier had sailed from Port St. Nazaire, with a band
of Scotch and Irish adventurers, who, after much peril,
arrived in the Hebrides. The Regency, in London,
offered a reward of 30,000<abbr title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr> to anyone who should
capture him on British ground. On the 4th of June
King James <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> was proclaimed, at Perth, King of
Great Britain. On the 10th a similar proclamation
was made at Edinburgh. Five days later the Highland
army attacked, and in ten minutes, utterly routed Sir
John Cope, seven miles from Edinburgh, near Preston
Pans, and Gladsmuir. This victory left almost the
whole of Scotland in possession of the Jacobites,—and
the road open to them to invade England. They did
not reach Carlisle till the 15th of November. On the
24th they were in Lancaster. On the 28th they
entered Manchester, imposed a heavy requisition on the
town, and were joined by some bold spirits among
the younger men. On the 1st of December, Charles
Edward entered Macclesfield. On the 4th that young
prince, with 7,000 men, entered Derby, and losing
heart, left it on the 6th, in retreat northward. On<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
the 9th they were again in Manchester. On Christmas
day, they entered Glasgow;—‘a very indifferent
Christmas-box to the inhabitants,’ according to Ray;
and on the 30th of December, Carlisle, in which a
rebel garrison was stationed, surrendered at discretion
to the young Duke of Cumberland. Therewith ended
the rebel invasion of England. This succession of
events greatly influenced the metropolis.</p>

<p>When the storm was threatening, and also when it
burst, clergymen in town, and probably in the country
also, opened their Bibles, questioning them as oracles,
and interpreting the answers, according to their respective
temperaments. One good man, whose eye
fell upon the words of Jeremiah,—‘Evil appeareth out
of the North, and great destruction,’ proclaimed to his
congregation that the words had reference to the Pretender
and his invasion of England. This application
of the text has been pronounced to be as absurd as
that of the ‘casting down of Mount Seir’ to the overthrow
of the French.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>FEELING IN LONDON.</i></div>

<p>For what London was feeling and saying in this
eventful year, 1745, search must be made in the correspondence
of the time. The letters of Walpole, for
instance, begin the year with the expression of a fear,
if Marshal Belleisle, who had been made a prisoner at
Hanover, where he was travelling without a passport,
should be allowed to go at large, on his word, in
England, as it was reported he would be, that mischief
would come of it. ‘We could not have a worse inmate!
<span class="sni"><i>HOPES AND FEARS.</i></span>
So ambitious and intriguing a man, who was the author<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
of this whole war, will be no bad general to head the
Jacobites on any insurrection.’ The marshal was, at
first, kept ‘magnificently close’ at Windsor, but as he
cost the country there 100<abbr title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr> a day, he was sent to
Nottingham, to live there as he pleased, and for the
Jacobites to make what they could of him. For the
moment, the Duke of Beaufort was more dangerous
than the marshal. The duke was a declared, determined
and an unwavering Jacobite, and led the party
against Court and Ministry. At the end of April there
was ‘nothing new.’ In May came the honourable
catastrophe of Fontenoy, and the dishonourable sarcastic
song made by Frederick, Prince of Wales, on his
brother, the Duke of Cumberland’s glorious failure.
Alluding to the duke, Walpole writes, ‘All the letters
are full of his humanity and bravery. He will be as
popular with the lower class of men as he has been for
three or four years with the low women. He will be
the soldiers’ ‘<em>Great Sir</em>,’ as well as theirs. I am
really glad; it will be of great service to the family if
any one of them come to make a figure.’ Walpole
saw the necessity of having a hero opposed to the
young Chevalier. One was sorely needed. Belleisle
must have enchanted the Jacobites by his publicly
asserting that this country was so ill-provided for
defence, he would engage, with five thousand scullions
of the French army, to conquer England. Walpole
owned his fears. He was depressed by our disasters in
Flanders, the absence of the king from England, that
of ministers from London, ‘not five thousand men in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
the island, and not above fourteen or fifteen ships at
home. Allelujah!’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>HORACE WALPOLE’S IDEAS.</i></div>

<p>The Ministry released Belleisle, who went <i lang="la">incog.</i>
about London, and was entertained at dinner by the
Duke of Newcastle at Claremont, and by the Duke of
Grafton at Hampton Court. Walpole compares the
idle gossip about the French coming over in the interest
of the Pretender, and the neglect of all defence, with
the conduct of the Londoners on a report that the
plague was in the city. ‘Everybody went to the house
where it was, to see it!’ If Count Saxe, with ten
thousand men, were to come within a day’s march of
London, ‘people will be hiring windows at Charing
Cross and Cheapside to see them pass by.’ Walpole,
in truth, was as indifferent as he accused his contemporaries
of being. If anything happened to the ship,
what was that to him, he was only a passenger. He
playfully described himself as learning scraps from
‘Cato,’ in case of his having to depart in the old, high,
Roman fashion. Recollecting that he is writing on the
anniversary of the accession of the House of Brunswick,
he tacks a joyous P.S. to one of his letters, in the
words, ‘Lord! ’tis the first of August, 1745, a holiday
that is going to be turned out of the almanack!’
When the Government <em>did</em> begin to prepare for serious
contingencies, Walpole expressed his belief of their
being about as able to resist an invasion as to make one.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>DIVISIONS IN FAMILIES.</i></div>

<p>When the young Chevalier, stealing a march upon
Cope, was approaching Edinburgh, Walpole wrote
from London, that people there had nothing to oppose,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
‘scarcely fears.’ Lord Panmure, who had got his title
through the attainder of his elder brother, for the ’15
affair, and the Duke of Athol, who owed his dukedom
to the attainder of his elder brother, the Marquis of
Tullibardine (who was then with Prince Charles
Edward), for the same affair, left London, in order to
raise forces in Scotland for the defence of the Hanoverian
succession. Panmure, with other Scotch lords,
raised a few men. Athol returned to London to
announce his inability to get together a force for such
a purpose; and when it was proposed to send the
Duke of Argyle, Maccullummore excused himself on
the singular ground that there was a Scotch Act of
Parliament against arming without authority. There was
a scene in a London house that might furnish a subject
to a painter. The young Whig Duke of Gordon, at an
interview with his Jacobite uncle, told the latter that he
must go down to Scotland and arm his men. ‘They are
in arms,’ was the reply. ‘You must lead them against
the rebels.’ ‘They will wait on the Prince of Wales,’
rejoined the uncle, who alluded to the young Chevalier.
The duke flew in a passion, but the uncle pulled out a
pistol, and said it was in vain to dispute. As Walpole
here drops the curtain over this scene, we may suppose
that the little domestic drama was carried no further.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>COURT AND CITY.</i></div>

<p>As news reached town that the rebellion did not
grow in the North, and that there was no rising in
England to help it, Walpole wrote, ‘Spirit seems to
rise in London.’ The king, or as Walpole calls
him, ‘the person most concerned,’ took events with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
heroic imperturbability, or stupid indifference. Charles
Edward had repealed the union between England and
Scotland. King George believed himself to be, and
likely to remain, King of Great Britain, as before.
When ministers proposed to him any measures with
reference to the outbreak, his Majesty only answered,
‘Pooh! don’t talk to me about that stuff!’ It is not,
therefore, to be wondered at that ministers did not
summon Parliament. They had nothing either to offer
or to notify. The London merchants, on the other
hand, were zealous and liberal in opening subscriptions
for raising more troops.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>VARYING OPINIONS.</i></div>

<p>In this time of uncertainty, if not trouble, the
professional patriot came to the surface in the person
of Alderman Heathcote. At a City meeting, that
sham Jacobite proposed to supplant a loyal address
to the king by a demand for a redress of grievances;
‘but not one man seconded him.’ Walpole, with
all his affected indifference and pretence of indifference
on the part of the public, betrays the true
temper of the metropolis, when he says, ‘We have
great hopes the Highlanders will not follow him
[Charles Edward] so far [into England], very few of
them could be persuaded the last time to go to Preston.’
And something of the general uneasiness may
be traced in Walpole’s intimation to Montagu, of his
dislike of becoming ‘a loyal sufferer in a thread-bare
coat, and shivering in an antechamber at Hanover, or
reduced to teach Latin and English to the young
princes at Copenhagen. Will you ever write to me in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
my garret at Herrenhausen?’ With all this simulation
of light-heartedness, Walpole writes seriously enough,
from Arlington Street, ‘Accounts from Scotland vary
perpetually, and at best are never very certain....
One can’t tell what assurances of support they may
have from the Jacobites in England ... but nothing
of the sort has yet appeared.... One can hardly believe
that the English are more disaffected than the
Scotch, and among the latter no persons of property
have joined them.’ The temper of the Government
is also described in a few words: ‘Lord Granville and
his faction persist in persuading the king that it is an
affair of no consequence; and, for the Duke of Newcastle,
he is glad when the rebels make any progress
in order to refute Lord Granville’s assertions.’ London
was as delighted as Walpole with the naval watch
kept in the Channel, and with the spirit of the English
nobility adding, or promising to add, regiments to the
regular force, to which, however, they gave little or no
additional strength. He who had been laughing and
calling others laughers, confesses in September that
his own apprehensions were not so strong as they had
been. ‘If we get over this I shall believe that we
never can be hurt, for we never can be more exposed
to danger. Whatever disaffection there is to the present
family, it plainly does not proceed from love to
the other.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>LONDON WIT.</i></div>

<p>This sense of security was seriously shaken when
London got the news of the victory gained by Charles
Edward’s army near Preston Pans over General Cope.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
It was known to ‘the Papists’ on Sunday, but the
Government received no official news till Tuesday!
‘The defeat,’ says Walpole, ‘frightens everybody but
those it rejoices.’ Then <em>he</em>, who had alternately
laughed and trembled, affected the philosopher, and
pretended that he could endure without emotion the
ruin which he had foreseen. ‘I shall suffer with fools,
without having any malice to our enemies, who act
sensibly from principle and interest.’ When London
found that no advantage was taken of the victory by
the victors, London and Walpole resumed their good
spirits. The latter referred to the subjoined advertisement
as a proof that there was more wit in London
than in all Scotland. ‘To all jolly Butchers.—My dear
Hearts! The Papists eat no meat on Wednesdays,
Fridays, Saturdays, nor during Lent! Your friend,
John Steel.’ Such wit can hardly have alarmed the
Papists, but it may have had something to do with a
report which followed,—that they intended to rise
and massacre their enemies in London. It was taken
seriously. All the Guards were ordered out, and the
Tower was closed at seven o’clock. When the murrain
among the cattle broke out, it was absurdly said that
the Papists had poisoned the pools! The Papists
however did send money contributions from London
to Charles Edward. It is wonderful that the highwaymen
did not intercept the bearers, and make them
deliver.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE PARLIAMENT.</i></div>

<p>When Parliament met in October, the attendance
was thin. The Pretender had threatened to confiscate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
the property of all Scotch members who should attend,
and to make it treason for English members to do so!
Yet there were Jacobites present, and they opposed
the address as well as the suspension of the Habeas
Corpus. A proposal to enquire into the causes of
the progress of the Rebellion was shelved by a majority
of 194 to 112. Most of the former felt, it is
said, ‘the necessity of immediately putting an end to
it, and that the fire should be quenched before we
should enquire who kindled or promoted it.’</p>

<p>There were many whose fears had been great
because of the greatness of the stake. These rejoiced
when the Guards left London, roaring as they marched
from the parade that they would neither give nor
receive quarter. Walpole affirmed that the army
adored the duke who was to be their commander.
On the other hand, ‘the Calligulisms’ of the Prince of
Wales brought on him a general contempt. The
working men were, almost without exception, loyal.
When there was an idea of the king going to the
encampment at Finchley, the weavers offered him a
guard of a thousand men. It was in the caricature of
the march to Finchley that Hogarth exhibited the
baser side of his character. The wrath of the king at
the painter’s insult to the defenders of their country
was well-founded. The popular feeling was not with
the artist. When the prisoners captured in the
‘Soleil’ were brought to London, it was difficult to
save them from being cruelly handled.
<span class="sni"><i>THE RADCLIFFES.</i></span>
Among them
was Mr. Radcliffe who had been condemned to death<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
with his brother, Lord Derwentwater, in 1716, and
Mr. Radcliffe’s son, who was at first suspected of being
Charles Edward’s brother, Henry. This suspicion very
nearly cost the young captive his life, more than once,
on the road. ‘He said that he had heard of English
mobs, but could not conceive they were so dreadful;
and wished he had been shot at the battle of Dettingen,
where he had been engaged. The father, whom they
call Lord Derwentwater, said, on entering the Tower,
that he had never expected to arrive there alive. For
the young man, he must only be treated as a French
captive; for the father it is sufficient to produce him
at the Old Bailey, and prove that he is the individual
person condemned for the last Rebellion; and so to
Tyburn.’ Walpole reflected the general feeling of the
metropolis which had been kept so long in a state
of suspense, sometimes concealing it under indifference,
at others not caring to conceal its own fears.</p>

<p>Noblemen’s servants were not rendered particularly
cheerful in October, by a report that they were to be
made to serve as soldiers, receiving their pay both as
warriors and flunkeys. The soldiery were so ill off,
that civilians bestirred themselves for their relief. The
Quakers contributed ten thousand woollen waistcoats
to keep them warm. The Corporation of London
gave them as many blankets and watchcoats. King
George, when everything else had been provided, paid
for their shoes out of his privy purse!</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE LONDON JACOBITES.</i></div>

<p>There was a desire to bring the matter to a conclusion
as cheaply as possible. The ‘Craftsman’ recommended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
that the Pretender should be ‘cut off,’ if
that end could be compassed. A hope was expressed
that the nation would not be taxed for encountering
a ‘ragged, hungry rabble of Yahoos of Scotch Highlanders,’
with the cost of an expedition against an
Alexander. There would be no use, it was said, in
constructing an apparatus fit for hunting a lion,—for
the catching of a rat. The rats were, nevertheless,
troublesome, if not formidable. The London Jacobites
were ostentatiously ecstatic when news reached town
of the defeat of Cope. King George’s proclamation
had ordered an observation of silence on public affairs.
When the removal of notorious Papists from the city
had been contemplated, ‘What will you get,’ loudly
asked the Jacobites of the Romish Church, ‘by driving
us ten miles out of town? We shall then form a
camp, and you will find us a much more formidable
body than we now appear to be while dispersed among
you.’ Remove the Papists! why, the Duke of Newcastle
had shown so little disposition that way, that
his French cook still ruled supreme in the kitchen of
his mansion in Lincoln’s Inn Fields! There were
others like the duke; and, what trust could be placed
in a militia formed out of servants of noblemen whose
lackeys went to mass in the private chapels of the
Ambassadors? Yet, something must be done. It was
in vain that proclamations, signed ‘James <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>’ and
‘Charles Edward,’ were burnt at the Royal Exchange,
by the common hangman, in presence of the sheriffs.
New documents were circulated as widely as ever.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
If they were not cried in the street, there were other
ways of bringing them before the public. In the dusk
of the evening, a baker would rest with his basket, or
a street porter with his burthen, against a wall.
Inside the basket, as inside the porter’s burthen, there
was a little boy who had all the necessary contrivances
to enable him to paste a Jacobite paper on the wall.
In the morning, London was found to be covered with
treasonable documents, and for some time, magistrates
were driven almost mad in trying to account for the
appearance of papers which seemed to have got on the
walls by inexplicable and undiscoverable means.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE VENETIAN AMBASSADOR.</i></div>

<p>On Sunday, October 6th, half of riotous London
followed the Foot Guards to Lincoln’s Inn Fields, and
applauded them as they entered the old abandoned
play-house, which was converted by them into a
barrack. A couple of days later all uproarious London
was on the river, or in the streets, to witness the grand
entry of the Venetian Ambassador. His Excellency
and suite came in state barges from Greenwich to the
Tower, and he passed in greater state still of coach
and cavalry, from the Tower to his noble residence in
<em>Thrift</em> Street, Soho, as Frith Street was once called.
The greetings which welcomed him on the part of
those who hailed in his person an ally of King George,
were as nothing compared with the unceasing thunder
of hurrah-ing which saluted him as he rode, next day,
in greatest state of all, to have audience of the sovereign.
When his wife, as soon as she was installed in
her house, in Soho, gave a masquerade which made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
everybody forget the perils of the time, there may
have been people who distrusted her Popish principles,
but no one doubted her taste, or objected to her
politics.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>MONARCH AND MINISTERS.</i></div>

<p>Yet was there every now and then a cry of alarm.
Messengers had seized a waggon load of cutlasses, and
they were slow to believe that the weapons were not
ordered by Pope and Pretender for the slaughter of
Church-and-King men. They proved to have come
to London in due course of trade. Persons who believed,
nevertheless, in the existence of a conspiracy
were gratified by the seizure of some Irish priests who
indulged in the utterance of seditious words in public
places. Zealots, of Jacobite proclivities, even had the
assurance to contradict loyal preachers in their own
pulpits, but afterwards found themselves in durance
for their boldness. One day, Sir Robert Ladbroke
astounded the Duke of Newcastle by rushing in to his
office and announcing that he had had anonymous
warning to leave his house, as Jacobite insurgents
meant on a certain night to set fire to the city. Everywhere
guards were doubled, and there was much fear.
The king showed none. He stood for a couple of
hours on the terrace at St. James’s, overlooking the
park, to witness the manœuvres and the ‘march past’
of six regiments of trained bands, and he had an air
as if he and danger were strangers. Moreover the
Londoners were in a fever of delight with the other
king,—the king of the city. On Lord Mayor’s day,
Sir Richard Hoare was resolved that if he was to be the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
last Protestant Lord Mayor of London, people should
remember him. On October 29th (old Lord Mayor’s
day), he went from Guildhall to the Court of Exchequer,
in the grandest coach ever seen, and he was
accompanied by ‘a large body of associated gentlemen
out of Fleet Street, completely clothed,’ as one, indeed,
might expect they would be!</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>NEWS IN PRIVATE LETTERS.</i></div>

<p>From the ‘Letters of the First Earl of Malmesbury,
his Family and Friends,’ it is to be gathered that the
Londoners were kept in ignorance of Sir John Cope’s
defeat, till private letters arrived by which the whole
disgrace was revealed. Lord Shaftesbury writes that
Pitt’s respectful motion to advise the king to recall the
troops (chiefly cavalry) from Flanders, and use them
in suppressing the rebellion, was lost, or ‘eluded,’ by
putting the previous question—ayes 136, noes 148; in
which division young Horace Walpole was in the
minority, and old Horace Walpole on the other side;
‘not a Tory on either side speaking. I leave you to
reflect on this proceeding, though I think a very little
reflection will suffice.’ People who had letters from
the north ran with them from house to house, some,
even, to St. James’s, to impart their contents, and small
regard was had to any of the newspapers. But individuals
could be as untrustworthy as the papers. Old
Lord Aylesbury was conspicuous as a ‘terror-raiser.’
He says ‘the Papists poisoned his grandfather, and
made a fool of his father, and that he believed all the
Jacobites would turn to Popery very easily, if it was
to prevail.’ The old lord was to be seen daily going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
to Court, ‘to show his public attachment to the Revolution
of 1688.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE LONDON TRAINBANDS.</i></div>

<p>With respect to the king reviewing the Trainbands
from the garden wall of St. James’s, recorded in a
preceding page, Lord Shaftesbury writes, <abbr title="October">Oct.</abbr> 26th,
1745: ‘This morning the Trainbands were reviewed
by his Majesty. By what I saw of them myself, I can
venture to affirm that, notwithstanding their deficiency
in smartness, from want of an uniform, which may
possibly expose them to the ridicule of some of our
very fine gentlemen, they would make an honourable
and effective stand, if needful, for their religion and
liberties. They are really, upon the whole, good
troops.’ The Rev. William Harris gives a fuller account
of the same incident to his brother: ‘I was to-day
accidentally in St. James’s Park, when the City Militia
were reviewed by the King, who stood on the terrace
in his own garden, attended by the Duke, Lord Stair,
Dukes of Dorset, Newcastle, Bolton, and several others
of the nobility. It was a most tedious affair, I make
no doubt, to his Majesty; for the London men made
but a shabby appearance, and there could be no great
entertainment in seeing them. Their officers were well
enough, and to these, as they made their salute, passing
by under the terrace, his Majesty returned everyone the
compliment by pulling off his hat. There were no less
than six regiments, and I suppose it might be near two
hours before they all had gone in review before his
Majesty.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>SCENES AT COURT.</i></div>

<p>Conflicting reports flew about, but the discouragement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
was not very profound, and the birthday drawing-room,
on the 30th of October, was as gay and brilliant
as if there were no rebellion afoot. The reverend
writer of the letter quoted above was present, and he
describes to Mrs. Harris the silks of the princesses, the
brocades and damasks of the ladies, and the blaze of
Lady Cardigan, who excelled as to jewels, having on a
magnificent solitaire, and her stomacher all over diamonds.
There, too, fluttered the Prince of Wales in
light blue velvet and silver; the Duke of Cumberland
strolled about with a little more gold lace than
usual on his scarlet uniform; and Lord Kildare outdid
all other fine and loyal gentlemen present, ‘in a light
blue silk coat, embroidered all over with gold and
silver, in a very curious manner, turned up with white
satin, embroidered as the other; the waistcoat the same
as his sleeves.’ But the grandest and quaintest figure
there was the Venetian ambassadress, who had gone in
state from Frith Street, Soho, to the intense delight of
the ‘mob.’ This lady ‘drew most people’s attention
by somewhat of singularity both in her air and dress,
which was pink, all flounced from top to bottom, with
fringe of silver interspersed. She looks extremely
young, has the French sort of behaviour, and was
much taken notice of and spoke to by all the Royal
Family in the Circle.’ The most soberly-dressed man
there was the king himself. He wore a deep blue
cloth coat and waistcoat trimmed with silver, and was
as good humoured and gracious as if Johnny Cope was
carrying all before him in the north.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE KING’S SPEECH TO THE GUARDS.</i></div>

<p>The regiments which arrived in London, in November,
from Fontenoy, kept the metropolis in some commotion,
till they were pushed forward, after brief rest,
to the midland counties. While they were receiving
tents and arms at the Tower, the Duke of Cumberland
had his headquarters at St. James’s, whence orders
were issued (says Mr. Maclachlan—‘Order Book of the
Duke of Cumberland’) of the most minute character
and detail.</p>

<p>The king has been accused of indifference to passing
events, and of having only reluctantly allowed the
Duke of Cumberland, who served so nobly with him
at Dettingen, to command the army against the young
Chevalier. Perhaps, what seemed indifference was
confidence in the result. There is evidence, however,
that he was not without anxiety at this critical juncture.
In Hamilton’s ‘History of the Grenadier Guards,’ there
is the following description of a scene at St. James’s,
quoted from Wraxall. The incident described is said
to have occurred at the military levee held by the king,
previous to the Guards marching to the north: ‘When
the officers of the Guards were assembled, the king is
said to have addressed them as follows: “Gentlemen,
you cannot be ignorant of the present precarious situation
of our country, and though I have had so many
recent instances of your exertions, the necessities of the
times and the knowledge I have of your hearts, induce
me to demand your service again; so all of you that
are willing to meet the rebels hold up your right hand;
all those who may, from particular reasons, find it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
inconvenient, hold up your left.” In an instant, all the
right hands in the room were held up, which so affected
the king, that in attempting to thank the company, his
feelings overpowered him; he burst into tears and
retired.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ASPECTS OF SOCIETY.</i></div>

<p>While this scene was being acted at St. James’s,
Mrs. Elizabeth Montagu, then residing in Dover Street,
wrote to Dr. Freind: ‘People of the greatest rank here
have been endeavouring to make the utmost advantage
of the unhappy state of their country, and have <em>sold</em>
the assistance it was their duty to <em>give</em>. Self-interest
has taken such firm possession of every breast, that
not any threatening calamity can banish it in the
smallest instance. There is no view of the affair more
melancholy than this.... Everything is turned to a
job, and money given for the general good is converted
too much to private uses.... There were some exceptions.
Almost all our nobility,’ she writes, ‘are gone
to the army, so that many of the great families are in
tears, and indeed it makes the town appear melancholy
and dismal.’ There were exceptions in this case.
‘Let it be said, to the honour of our sex, there are no
dramas, no operas, and plays are unfrequented; and
there is not a woman in England, except Lady Brown,
that has a song or tune in her head; but indeed her
ladyship is very unhappy at the suspension of operas.’
On the night this letter was written, Mrs. Clive’s Portia,
at Drury Lane, was unattractive, in spite of her
imitations of eminent lawyers, in the trial scene; and
Mrs. Pritchard’s Lappet was equally unavailing to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
bring the public to witness ‘The Miser,’ at Covent Garden.
But Rich’s three nights of the ‘Beggars’ Opera,’
for the benefit of the patriotic fund, produced happy
results. From Mrs. Cibber down to the candle-snuffers,
all sacrificed their pay with alacrity.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>FRENCH NEWS OF LONDON.</i></div>

<p>As correct news of the condition of London in the
latter half of the year, it was stated in the French
papers that insurrectionary undertakings prevailed; that
the principal shops were closed; that suspected peers
were under arrest; that an attempt had been made to
murder the Archbishop of Canterbury, and that the
Tower had been captured by a Jacobite mob, who had
liberated nearly three hundred prisoners! Every <i lang="la">quidnunc</i>
in Paris turned to the article ‘London’ in the
‘Gazette de France,’ to read with avidity of the closing
of great firms, the breaking of the chief banks, and
the bewilderment of the king on his reaching the
capital from Hanover. The ‘Gazette’ had no doubt
of the crowning of James Stuart in Westminster Abbey
during the Christmas holidays; and, perhaps, hoped
for the appearance of ‘the Elector of Hanover’ on
Tower Hill!</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ANXIETY AND CONFIDENCE.</i></div>

<p>On Friday, the 5th December 1745, it is undeniable
that London was shaken into terror and consternation by
the news of the arrival of Charles Edward on the Wednesday
at Derby. It was long remembered as ‘Black
Friday.’ ‘Many of the inhabitants,’ says the Chevalier
de Johnstone, in his ‘Memoirs of the Rebellion,’ ‘fled
to the country with their most precious effects, and all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
the shops were shut. People thronged to the Bank to
get payment of its notes; and it only escaped bankruptcy
by a stratagem. Payment was not indeed refused;
but as they who came first were entitled to
priority of payment, the bank took care to be continually
surrounded by agents with notes, who were paid in
sixpences in order to gain time. Those agents went
out at one door with the specie they had received, and
brought it back by another; so that the <i lang="la">bonâ fide</i>
holders of notes could never get near enough to present
them, and the bank by this artifice preserved its credit,
and literally faced its creditors.’</p>

<p>This, of course, was imaginary. The metropolis
recovered its tranquility. The king, on his side, regained
his equanimity. At a levee, held in December,
his Majesty and Lord Derby disputed pretty loudly
as to the numbers of the rebels. ‘Sir,’ said Lord
Derby, who had just arrived from Lancashire, whoever
tells you the rebels are fewer than 10,000 deceives
you;’ which was, as Mr. Harris writes, thought to be
a pretty strong expression for his Lordship to use to
the king. At a court held a day or two later, Sir
Harry Liddel, just from the north, was asked by his
Majesty what Sir Harry held the rebel force to be?
He answered about 7,000, to which estimate the king
seemed to assent; but this did not prevent the whole
Court and City from falling into the utmost panic again
before the end of December. The alternation of hope and
fear however passed suddenly into confidence, when, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
the year ended, news reached the London coffee-houses
that young Cumberland was likely to turn the tide of
rebel success. Carlisle was evidently on the point of
surrendering, and this important event took place at
the close of the year 1745.</p>

<p>Down to that close, traitors were as closely looked
for in London as rebels were now pursued in their
retreat. Whether through delicacy or ignorance, the
style in which a successful ‘take’ of traitors was made
was comically mysterious. For example, in this month
of December, the papers announced that ‘A Musician
who resided some years in London as a foreign Nobleman,
and an Irish Comedian who has acted five years
on the English Stage, were committed to the Marshalsea
for High Treason.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>JOHNSON AND LORD GOWER.</i></div>

<p>In this eventful year, Jacobite Johnson was quietly
engaged on his Dictionary. Aloof from the fray, he
could not forbear flinging a stone on an ex-Jacobite
who had ratted. When he came to the word ‘renegade,’
he remembered Lord Gower’s abandonment of
the old Jacobite interest, for place at Court; and his
prejudice prompted him to make Lord Gower infamous
for ever, by adding his name to the vocabulary of slang.
‘When I came to the word <em>renegade</em>,’ he said to Boswell,
‘after telling that it meant “one who deserts to
the enemy; a revolter,” I added, “sometimes we say
a <span class="smcap">Gower</span>.” Thus it went to the press; but the printer
had more wit than I, and struck it out.’ Another
distinguished man was looking on events with an indifference<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
which seems affectation.
<span class="sni"><i>BOLINGBROKE.</i></span>
‘I expect no good
news,’ writes Bolingbroke to Marchmont, in September,
‘and am therefore contented to have none. I wait
with much resignation to know to what Lion’s paw we
are to fall.’</p>

<span class="smcap">n</span> the first day of the year 1746, the parole
given at the Duke of Cumberland’s headquarters,
at Carlisle, was ‘London.’ He
well knew the joy the metropolis would
soon receive. Part of the general orders then issued was
thus expressed: ‘The Rebels that have or shall be
taken, either concealed or attempting their escape, or
in any ways evading the Capitulation, to be immediately
put in Irons, in order to be hanged.’ After publishing
this order, the duke, leaving Hawley to cross the border
in pursuit of the young Chevalier, returned to
London. There was great fear of a French invasion;
and the duke was to have the command of a southern
army to repel it. The invaders were expected in
Suffolk, and the Jacobites hoped that the expectation
would be realised. They often reported it as an established
fact. Fielding’s Jacobite squire in ‘Tom Jones’
is made to exclaim to the landlord of the inn at Upton:
‘All’s our own, boy! ten thousand honest Frenchmen
are landed in Suffolk. Old England for ever! Ten
thousand French, my brave lad! I am going to tap

<div class="sidenote"><i>WAR CRITICISM.</i></div>

<p>Carlisle being recaptured, London breathed again,
and considered its past perils and future prospects. The
fire-side critics of the war concluded, as the Earl of
Shaftesbury did with his friends in London, ‘that <i lang="la">eminus</i>,
we exceeded the ancients, but <i lang="la">cominus</i> we fell
below them; and this was the result of our having, it
was said, learnt the art of war from the Spaniards.
We never used bayonets in our service till after the
battle of Steinkirk, in King William’s time. Now the
Highlanders by their way of attacking (new to our
troops) make a quick impression and throw our men
into confusion. This I imagine to be the principal
reason of the Highlanders gaining such repeated advantages.’
Walpole wrote from Arlington Street: ‘With
many other glories, the English courage seems gone
too.’ Yet the old spirit was not extinct. When the
Ministry tried to prevent Mr. Conway going as aide-de-camp
with the Duke of Cumberland, on the ground of
his being in Parliament, the duke informed the young
soldier of the fact. ‘He burst into tears,’ says Walpole,
‘and protested that nothing should hinder his
going—and he is gone.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>BREAKING AN OFFICER.</i></div>

<p>Without being uneasy at the idea of invasion the
Government took precautions in case of emergency. It
was announced that at the firing of seven guns at the
Tower, answered by the same number in St. James’s
Park, soldiers and officers should repair to previously
named places of rendez-vous. No crowds were allowed
to assemble. A race between two pairs of chairmen,
carrying their chairs, round the Park, having caused a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
large mob to gather within hail of the palace, was stopped
in mid career by a file of musqueteers, who drove competitors
and spectators into the neighbouring streets.
When the park was pretty well cleared, Captain Stradwick
was brought out and ‘broke,’ for desertion. Why
he was not shot, as the king said he deserved to be, was
owing to some influence which seemed to be stronger
than the king himself. Perhaps, as a consequence, the
common rank and file who had deserted were allowed
their lives, but at dear cost. They got a thousand
lashes, administered half at a time, in Hyde Park; and
on the off days the mob were regaled with the sight of
soldiers getting their five hundred stripes for speaking
evil of his Majesty in their drink.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>REBEL PRISONERS.</i></div>

<p>Meanwhile, the river one day suddenly swarmed
with galleys, which picked up numbers of ‘useful
fellows to serve the king.’ Even the City taverns were
broken into, and there similar seizure was made, but
not without occasional mortal frays, in which there
was much promiscuous shooting, and a forcible carrying
off of other ‘useful fellows,’ who were hurried on board
tenders, and thence sent to sea. There was hardly
time for sympathy. A few women in the streets and
by the river side filled the air with shrieks and clamour,
but they were not much heeded. London became full
of expectancy of the renewal of an old and a rare
spectacle. The Carlisle prisoners were on their road
to town. There were nearly four hundred of them,
including about threescore officers. Those who were
able to march were tied in couples, and two dragoons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
had charge of ten prisoners, one leading them by a
rope from his saddle, the other ‘driving them up.’ The
captured officers were mounted, but their arms and legs
were tied. Batches of other captive men were sent by
sea; some seem to have been exceptionally treated.
The papers announced the arrival of ‘six coaches and
six,’ filled with rebel prisoners, under an escort of
horse and foot. The London gaols were emptied of
felons, who were transferred to distant prisons, in order
to ‘accommodate’ the captives till they were otherwise
disposed of. But the most important arrival was that
of the hero himself. The Duke of Cumberland, fresh
from Carlisle, reached London on a dark January
morning, at seven o’clock. Much was made of his
having passed only ‘one night in bed,’ in that now
easy day’s journey. The duke came with modesty and
great becomingness. Shortly after reaching St. James’s
he went straight to the little Chapel Royal. At the
subsequent usual Sunday drawing-room, there was
brilliancy with the utmost gaiety, such as had not
been witnessed for many a year. After a few days
the duke returned northward, departing with the same
modesty that had marked his arrival. He left at one in
the morning, but even at that ghostly hour, and in that
inclement season, he was done honour to by a crowd
which he could scarcely penetrate, whose torches were
flashed to their brightest, and whose voices were
pitched to the loudest, as their last ‘God speed!’ The
temper of London may be seen in one of Walpole’s
letters, in which he alludes to the too great favour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
which had been always shown towards Scotland since
the last rebellion; and he expresses a hope that the
duke will make an end of it.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>LONDON MOBS.</i></div>

<p>In the meantime, old rancour against the Jacobites
was embittered by the publication of various ‘provocating
pamphlets;’ and the month came to a conclusion
with the preachings of the 30th of January, and the
comments made on the sermons next day. Bishop
Mawson, of Chichester, preached before the Lords at
St. Peter’s, Westminster; Dr. Rutherford before the
Commons at St. Margaret’s; while a reverend gentleman,
who is variously called ‘Pursack’ and ‘Persover,’
aroused the echoes of St. Paul’s in the ears of the Lord
Mayor and Aldermen. Finally, an anonymous poet
swept the lyre in laudation of the duke. How he
made the chords ring may be gathered from a single
<span class="lock">line:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Blast, gracious God, th’ assassins’ hell-bred scheme!</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The London mob, on the Whig side of politics,
cannot be said to have been more civilised than the
same mob of thirty years earlier. One of its favourite
sights was to see Jacobite prisoners brought into London.
The captives were invariably ill-used; but there
was a much more humane feeling manifested for such
of them as might end their career by the axe or the
halter. One day in February upwards of forty officers
(including a French colonel of Engineers and four
Frenchmen of lower grade) were brought into London
in four waggons and a coach. The more dignified
vehicle carried the French colonel. They were guarded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
by a strongly-armed escort. Some were taken to the
New Prison in Southwark, some to Newgate. The
French colonel in the coach, and his four countrymen
in a cart, were driven to the Marshalsea. ‘They were
very rudely treated by the populace,’ say the newspapers,
‘who pelted them with dirt, and showed all
other marks of abhorrence of their black designs.’
Foreigners were just then looked upon with great suspicion.
<span class="sni"><i>AMBASSADORS’ CHAPELS.</i></span>
Two servants of the Portuguese and Sardinian
envoys, respectively, having let their tongues wag too
saucily at a tavern, under the shield, as they thought,
of ambassadorial protection, had been seized by the
constables and clapped into irons. The envoys demanded
their release; and much correspondence
ensued between the Home Office and the envoys. It
was settled that the legation could not shelter an
offender against the law, even though the offender
were a fellow-countryman of the legate. Some attempt
was made to compel the foreign representatives to
abstain from employing Popish priests of English birth
in the chapels annexed to the ambassadors’ private
residences. The answer was reasonable enough. As
their Excellencies could bring no foreign priests of
the Romish Church with them, they were obliged to
employ English ecclesiastics who were priests of that
Church, in the chapels of the respective embassies.
These were the only ‘mass houses’ to which English
Papists, it was said, could resort, and the Whigs denounced
them as the smithies where red hot conspiracy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
was beaten into shape between foreign hammers and a
British anvil.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE HAVOC OF WAR.</i></div>

<p>London Whig temper was irritated in another direction.
There was not only a reckless assertion of Jacobitism
on the part of the prisoners from the north, but
there was abundance of sympathy manifested for them.
Moreover, full permission was given to the practical
application of this sympathy. Jacobite visitors poured
into the prisons, and the captives ate, drank, and were
merry with them, regardless of what the morrow might
bring. Many of the prisoners had pockets well furnished
with gold; and where this was wanting it was
supplied by Jacobite outsiders. Scarcely a day passed
without waggoners or porters depositing in the first
lodge hampers of the richest wines and of the finest
delicacies. The warders rejoiced, for they took toll of
all; and the prison chaplains had some idea that this
good time was the beginning of the Millennium.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there was much more misery in
the loyal than in the Jacobite army. The Londoners saw
nothing for the encouragement of loyalty in such a sight
as the landing at the Tower wharf of some of the troops
that had been with Cope at Preston Pans. ‘The poor
men,’ say all the papers, ‘were in a most miserable
shocking condition. Some without arms or legs, others
their noses cut off and their eyes put out; besides being
hacked and mauled in many parts of their bodies, after
a most terrible and cruel manner.’ This ‘atrocity’ was
forgotten in the news that roused London in April.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>FLYING REPORTS.</i></div>

<p>The course of war in Scotland, from the beginning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
of the year to the 16th of April, was in this wise. On
the 17th of January Hawley was defeated at Falkirk.
On the 30th, the Duke of Cumberland arrived in Edinburgh.
March 14th, news came that the Highland army
had taken Fort Augustus and had blown up Fort
George. The Ladies Seaforth and Mackintosh headed
two rebel clans on the hills; but their husbands were
with the duke’s army! About the same time old Lord
Lovat stimulated the rebel resistance by proclaiming that
it was the intention of the Duke of Cumberland to transport
the Highlanders to America. On April 3rd, the
rebels captured Blair Castle, and on the 16th the duke’s
victory at Culloden proved decisive of the fate of the
Stuarts.</p>

<p>Exactly a week after the Duke of Cumberland
gained the victory, a <em>report</em> to that effect reached
London, but there was no news from the duke himself
till the 25th. His business-like account of the
battle appeared in the ‘London Gazette’ next day.
In the interim the London Jacobites in their places
of resort asserted loudly that the duke was in full
retreat; and it was whispered that if he was <em>hopelessly</em>
beaten, the ‘Papists would rise all over the kingdom.’
But <em>now</em> ‘hope’ herself was beaten out of the
souls of Papists and Jacobites. The military in London
were in a vein of swaggering delight. They
talked of the young duke’s briefly heroic address to a
cavalry regiment on the point of charging. He patted
the nearest man to him on the back, and cried aloud,
‘One brush, my lads, for the honour of old Cobham!’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
<span class="sni"><i>NEWS OF CULLODEN.</i></span>
Then was curiosity stirred in London barracks as to
which regiments were to get the prize for bravery, subscribed
by the Corporation of London—namely 5,000<abbr title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr>
The duke so wisely distributed it as to rebuke nobody.
Veterans at Chelsea were looking at the vacant spaces
where they should hang the captured flags, and were
disappointed when they heard at the Horse Guards that
the duke, considering that it was said how little honour
was connected with such trophies, had sent the flags to
Edinburgh to be burnt by the common hangman. The
Chelsea veterans, however, envied the capturers of the
(four) flags; for to each man the duke gave sixteen
guineas. Medals and crosses were not yet thought of. His
generosity was lauded as enthusiastically as his valour.</p>

<p>While the Jacobites were overwhelming him with
charges of cruelty and meanness, the friends of ‘the
present happy establishment’ were circulating stories
in and about London of his humanity and liberality.
Soldiers of the young Chevalier’s army had
wreaked their vengeance upon Mr. Rose, the minister
at Nairn—on himself and his house. He was a Whig
and anti-Romanist, who had favoured the escape of some
prisoners taken by the Jacobite army. The Highlanders
burnt his house, and, tying the minister up,
they gave him 500 lashes. The duke, on hearing of
this outrage, fell into uncontrollable fury, and swore he
would avenge it. If there was some savagery at and
after Culloden, no wonder! Such, at least, was the
London feeling among the duke’s friends. But the feeling
generally was one of ecstacy at the decisive victory.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
Lord Bury, who had arrived on the 25th with the news
direct from the duke to the king, could hardly walk
along the then terraced St. James’s Street for the congratulations
of the crowd. Nobody thought such a
halcyon messenger was too highly rewarded with a
purse of a thousand guineas, and with being nominated
own aide-de-camp to King George.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A POPULAR HOLIDAY.</i></div>

<p>That 25th of April was indeed a gala day for the
London mob. They had ample time for breakfast
before they gathered at the ‘end of New Bond Street,
in Tyburn Road’ (as Oxford Street was then called), to
see the young footman, Henderson, hanged for the murder
of his mistress, Lady Dalrymple. The culprit did
not die ‘game,’ and the brutes were disappointed, but
they found consolation in the fall of a scaffolding with
all its occupants. Then they had time to pour into
the Park and see four or five sergeants shot for trying
to desert from King George’s service to King James’s.
Moreover there was a man to be whipt somewhere in
the City, and a pretty group of sight-seers assembled
at Charing Cross in expectation of ‘a fellow in the
pillory.’ What with these delights, and the pursuing
Lord Bury with vociferations of sanguinary congratulation,
the day was a thorough popular holiday.</p>

<p>The anxiety that had been felt in London before
Culloden may be measured by the wild joy which
prevailed when the news of the victory arrived. Walpole,
in Arlington Street, on the evening of the
25th April, writes: ‘The town is all blazing around
me as I write with fireworks and illuminations.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
I have some inclination to wrap up half a dozen sky-rockets
to make you drink the duke’s health. Mr.
Dodington, on the first report, came out with a very
pretty illumination, so pretty that I believe he had it
by him, ready for any occasion.’</p>

<p>On the same evening the Rev. Mr. Harris wrote
from London to the mother of the future first Earl of
Malmesbury, just born: ‘You cannot imagine the prodigious
rejoicings that have been made this evening in
every part of the town; and indeed it is a proper time
for people to express their joy when the enemies of
their country are thus cut off.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CARLYLE AND SMOLLETT.</i></div>

<p>On that evening Alexander Carlyle was with
Smollett in the Golden Ball coffee-house, Cockspur
Street. ‘London,’ he says, ‘was in a perfect uproar
of joy. About nine o’clock I asked Smollett if he
was ready to go, as he lived at May Fair’ (Carlyle was
bound for New Bond Street on a supper engagement).
‘He said he was, and would conduct me. The mob
were so riotous and the squibs so numerous and incessant
that we were glad to go into a narrow entry to
put our wigs into our pockets, and to take our swords
from our belts and walk with them in our hands, as
everybody then wore swords; and after cautioning me
against speaking a word lest the mob should discover
my country and become insolent, “John Bull,” says
he, “is as haughty and valiant to-night, as he was
abject and cowardly on the Black Wednesday (Friday?)
when the Highlanders were at Derby.” After we got
to the head of the Haymarket through incessant fire,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
the doctor led me by narrow lanes where we met
nobody but a few boys at a pitiful bonfire, who very
civilly asked us for sixpence, which I gave them. I
saw not Smollett again for some time after, when he
showed Smith and me the manuscript of his “Tears of
Scotland,” which was published not long after, and had
such a run of approbation.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">‘<i>TEARS OF SCOTLAND.</i>’</div>

<p>Smollett was one of those Tories who, like many of
the Nonjurors, were not necessarily or consequently
Jacobites. They were more willing to make the best
of a foreign king than to risk their liberties under an
incapable bigot like James Stuart, who, save for the
accident of birth, was less of an Englishman and knew
less of England (in which, throughout his life, he had
only spent a few months) than either of the Georges.
But Smollett felt keenly the sufferings of his country,
and out of the feeling sprung his verses so full of a
tenderly expressed grief,—‘The Tears of Scotland!’
How that mournful ode was written in London in this
year of mournful memories for the Jacobites, no one
can tell better than Walter Scott. ‘Some gentlemen
having met at a tavern, were amusing themselves before
supper with a game of cards, while Smollett, not choosing
to play, sat down to write. One of the company
(Graham of Gartmoor), observing his earnestness and
supposing he was writing verses, asked him if it was
not so. He accordingly read them the first sketch of
the “Tears of Scotland,” consisting only of six stanzas,
and on their remarking that the termination of the
poem being too strongly expressed might give offence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
to persons whose political opinions were different, he
sat down without reply and, with an air of great indignation,
subjoined the concluding <span class="lock">stanza:—</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>INDIGNATION VERSES.</i></div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">While the warm blood bedews my veins</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Mourn, hapless Caledonia, mourn</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy banish’d peace, thy laurels torn!’</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The following were the lines which were supposed to
be likely to offend the friends of the hero of Culloden;
but the sentiment was shared by many who were not
friends of the Stuart <span class="lock">cause:—</span></p>

were thousands who believed it to be true to the very

<span class="smcap">he</span> players and the playwrights were zealous
Whigs throughout the rebellion. The
Drury Lane company to a man became
volunteers, under their manager, Mr. Lacy,
who had asked the royal permission to raise a couple
of hundred men, in defence of his Majesty’s person
and Government. To attract loyal audiences at a time
when the public could not be readily tempted to the
theatre, ‘The Nonjuror’ was revived, at both houses.
Two players, Macklin and Elderton, set to work to
produce plays for their respective theatres, on the subject
of Perkin Warbeck. While Macklin was delivering
what he wrote, piecemeal, to the actors, for study,
and Elderton was perspiring over his laborious gestation
of blank-verse, the proprietors of the playhouse
in Goodman’s Fields forestalled both by bringing out
Ford’s old play, which is named after the Pretender to
the throne of Henry <abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr> Macklin called his piece
‘Henry <abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr>, or the Popish Impostor.’ This absurd
allusion to Perkin was a shaft aimed at the actual
Pretender. The Whigs approved of both title and play,
and they roared at every line which they could apply<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
against Tories and Jacobites.
<span class="sni"><i>THE PLAYERS.</i></span>
At both houses, occasional
prologues stirred the loyal impulses or provoked
the indignation of the audience. At Covent Garden,
‘Tamerlane,’ which was always solemnly brought out
when the popular wrath was to be excited against
France, was preceded by a patriotic prologue which
Mrs. Pritchard delivered in her best manner, and
Dodsley sold the next day, as fast as he could deliver
copies over the counter of his shop in Pall Mall. Rich
and his Covent Garden players did not turn soldiers,
but he gave the house, <i lang="la">gratis</i>, for three days for the
benefit of a scheme that was to be to the advantage of
the veterans of the army; and this brought 600<abbr title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr> to
the funds. The actors sacrificed their salaries, and
charming Mrs. Cibber sang as Polly, in the ‘Beggars’
Opera’ more exquisitely than ever, to prove (as she said)
that, ‘though she was a Catholic, she was sincerely
attached to the family who was in possession of the
Throne, and she acknowledged the favour and honour
she had received from them.’ On the night when the
first report of the victory at Culloden was circulated,
Drury Lane got up a play that had not been acted for
thirty years, ‘The Honours of the Army,’ and Mrs.
Woffington, as ‘The Female Officer,’ ‘new dressed,’
spoke a dashing prologue. A night or two later,
Theophilus Cibber wrote and delivered a prologue on
the Duke of Cumberland’s victories. At Covent
Garden were revived two pieces, by Dennis: ‘Liberty
Asserted’ and ‘Plot and no Plot.’ Genest says of the
first piece that it was revived ‘for the sake of the invectives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
against the French; and “Plot and no Plot,” for
the sake of the cuts on the Jacobites,—at this time
almost every play was revived, which might be expected
to attract, from its political tendency.’</p>

<p>The minor, or unlicensed, theatres tempted loyal
people with coarser fare,—to the same end, keeping
up a hostile feeling against the French and the Jacobites.
Observe with what quaint delicacy the matter
is put in the following advertisements.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>SADLER’S WELLS AND THE NEW WELLS.</i></div>

<p>‘As the Proprietors of Sadler’s Wells have diligently
embraced every opportunity of giving their

guilty of the highest Error to have been silent
upon the present happy occasion. Every Class of

therefore they have endeavour’d to show a Natural

Spaw, Clerkenwell, with their Company, is thankfully
acknowledg’d; but Mr. Yeates humbly hopes that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
Ideas of Liberty and Courage (tho’ he confesses them
upon the present Occasion extremely influencing) will
not for the future so far transport his Audiences as to
prove of such Detriment to his Benches; several hearty

the illustrious Duke, whom we have so much
reason to admire, is happily represented) having exerted
their Canes in such a Torrent of Satisfaction as to
have render’d his Damage far from inconsiderable.’</p>

<p>The other ‘New Wells’ declined to be outdone.
There too, love and liquor were shown to be the reward
due to valiant Strephons returning from Culloden
to London. There, they were taught to ‘hate a
Frenchman like the Devil;’ and there, they and the
public might see all the phases of the half-hour’s battle,
and of some striking incidents before and after it, all
painted on one canvas.</p>

<p>It would, however, appear as if some of the bards,
like Bubb Dodington with his transparency, had so
contemplated the result of the war, as to be ready to
hail any issue, and any victor. One of these, the
Jacobites being defeated, wrote an epilogue, ‘designed
to be spoken by Mrs. Woffington, in the character of a
Volunteer;’—but the poem was not finished till
interest in the matter had greatly evaporated, and the
poet was told he was ‘too late.’ Of course, he shamed
the rogues by printing his work,—which is one illustrating
both the morals and the manners of the time.
It illustrates the former by infamously indecent
inuendo, and the latter by the following outburst, for
some of the ideas of which the writer had rifled
Addison’s ‘Freeholder.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE PRESS, ON CULLODEN.</i></div>

<p>The Whig press was, of course, jubilant. The
papers in the opposite interest put as good a face as
they could on the matter, and expressed a conviction
that they ‘ventured no treason in hoping that the
<em>weather might change</em>.’</p>

<p>The ‘Craftsman’ was, or affected to be, beside itself
for joy at the thought that no foreign mercenaries had
helped to reap the laurels at Culloden. The victory
was won by British troops only; and the duke might
say, like Coriolanus, ‘Alone, I did it!’ The ‘True
Patriot’ insisted on some share of the laurels being
awarded to the king, since he stood singly in refusing
to despair of the monarchy, when all other men were,
or seemed, hopeless and helpless. To which the
‘Western Journal’ added that not merely was the
king far-seeing, and the duke victorious at the head of
English troops without foreign auxiliaries, but that never
before had an English army made its way so far into
the country, to crush a Scottish foe. The ‘Journal,’
much read in all London coffee-houses resorted to by
Western gentlemen, was opposed to the killing of
rebels in cold blood, and could not see what profit
was to be got by hanging them. This paper suggested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
that some benefit might be obtained by making slaves
of them; not by transporting them to the Plantations,
but by compelling them to serve in the herring and
salmon fisheries, for the advantage of the compellers,
that is, the Government!</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>SAVAGERY AND SATIRE.</i></div>

<p>In the ‘General Advertiser,’ a man who probably
had reached the age when a sense of humanity fails
before any of the other senses, asked what objection
was to be found with such terms as ‘Extermination,’
‘Extirpation,’ and similar significances applied to those
savages, the Highlanders? This ogre, in his easy
chair, cared not to see that, in driving out a whole
race, more cruelty would be deliberately inflicted on
innocent human beings, than the savage Highlanders had
inflicted in their fury. And indeed, the latter did not
spare their own people, if the milkmaids’ song be true,
in which the illustrative line occurs, ‘We dare na
gae a milkin’ for fear o’ Charlie’s men.’ However,
the least punishment which the correspondent of the
‘Advertiser’ would accept was a general transportation
of the race to Africa and America, and a settlement
on their lands of English tenants at easy rents! This
sort of Highlander-phobia and the threatened application
of severe laws which included the suppression
of what has been called ‘the Garb of old Gael,’ or
Highland dress, gave rise to some good-natured satire.
‘We hear,’ said one of the newspapers, ‘that the
dapper wooden Highlanders, who guard so heroically
the doors of snuff shops, intend to petition the Legislature
in order that they may be excused from complying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
with the Act of Parliament with regard to their
change of dress, alleging that they had ever been
faithful subjects to his Majesty, having constantly
supplied his Guards with a pinch out of their Mulls,
when they marched by them; and so far from engaging
in any Rebellion, that they have never entertained
a rebellious thought, whence they humbly hope
that they shall not be put to the expense of buying
new Cloaths.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE CARICATURISTS.</i></div>

<p>So spoke the fun-loving spirits; but there were
baser spirits on the conquering side, and these speedily
exhibited an indecent exultation. The ignominious
caricaturists attracted crowds to the print shops to gaze
at the facility with which vulgar minds can degrade
solemn and lofty themes. On the one hand, the defeat
of the Highlanders and the consternation of Sullivan,
the standard-bearer in Charles Edward’s army, attracted
laughter. On the other hand, the too early, and
altogether vain, boast conveyed on the young Chevalier’s
banner, ‘Tandem triumphans,’ was more legitimately
satirised in an engraving in which the standard-bearer
is an ass, and on his standard are three crowns
surmounted by a coffin, with the motto ‘Tandem triumphans,’
done into English by the Duke of Cumberland,
as equivalent to ‘Every dog has his day;’—which,
after all, was no great compliment to the duke.
The triple crown and coffin represented the issue of
crown or grave; in one print the Devil is seen flying with
it over Temple Bar, as if it merited to be planted there,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
as were afterwards the spiked heads of Towneley and
of Fletcher.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>PSEUDO-PORTRAIT OF CHARLES EDWARD.</i></div>

<p>Jacobite sympathies were attracted and puzzled by
a portrait of ‘The young Chevalier,’ which was to be
seen, for sale, in every printshop. Alexander Carlyle
gives an amusing account of it in his ‘Autobiography.’
‘As I had seen,’ he says, ‘the Chevalier Prince Charles
frequently in Scotland, I was appealed to, if a print
that was selling in all the shops was not like him? My
answer was, that it had not the least resemblance.
Having been taken one night, however, to a meeting of
the Royal Society, by Microscope Baker, there was
introduced a Hanoverian Baron, whose likeness was so
strong to the print which passed for the young Pretender,
that I had no doubt that, he being a stranger,
the printsellers had got him sketched out, that they
might make something of it before the <em>vera effigies</em>
could be had. The latter, when it could at last be
procured, was advertised in cautious terms, as ‘A
curious Head, painted from the Life, by the celebrated
M. Torcque, and engraved in France, by J. G. Will,
with proper decorations in a new taste.’ Beneath the
portrait, the following verses were <span class="lock">inscribed:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Few know my face, though all men do my fame,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Look strictly and you’ll quickly guess my name.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Through deserts, snows, and rain I made my way,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My life was daily risk’d to gain the day.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Glorious in thought, but now my hopes are gone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Each friend grows shy, and I’m at last undone.’</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Fear of him, and of his followers, was far from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
having died out. A letter in the ‘Malmesbury Correspondence,’
dated May, might almost have been
written by the advocate of Extermination, in the ‘Advertiser;’—the
rev. writer says: ‘A Bill is now preparing
and will soon be brought into the House of
Lords, for putting the Highlands of Scotland under
quite a new regulation, and you may be assured,
until some bill is passed effectually to subdue that herd
of savages, we shall never be free from alarms of invasion
in the North of England.’</p>

<p>Lord Stair, then in London, was more hopeful, and
expressed a belief that the king would now have
weight in the affairs of Europe. ‘Fifty battalions and
fifty squadrons well employed, can cast the balance
which way his Majesty pleases.’ Derby captains now
looked to shake themselves out of mere tavern-life;
while spirited young fellows thought of commissions,
and the figure they would cut in new uniforms.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE DUKE OF ORMOND.</i></div>

<p>Meanwhile, the Government was not meanly hostile
to their dead enemies. The Duke of Ormond, the
boldest and frankest of conspirators against the Hanoverian
succession; the man who more than once would
have invaded his country at the head of foreign troops;
he who had fostered rebellion, and maintained foiled
rebels, during his thirty years’ exile, had, at last, died in
his eighty-third year. King and ministers made no
opposition to the interment of this splendid arch-traitor
in Westminster Abbey. His anonymous biographer
(1747), after stating that the duke died, on November
14th, 1745, at Avignon, says: ‘On the 18th, his body<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
was embalmed by four surgeons and three physicians,
and in the following month, May, as a bale of goods,
brought through France to England, and lodg’d in the
Jerusalem Chamber, and soon after, decently enterr’d.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>BURIAL OF ORMOND.</i></div>

<p>There was something more than mere ‘decency.’
In the ‘General Advertiser,’ May 23rd, it is announced,
but without a word of comment on the great Jacobite:—‘Last
night, about Eleven o’Clock, the Corps of the
late Duke of Ormond was, after lying in State, in the
Jerusalem Chamber, Westminster Abbey, interr’d in
great Funeral Pomp and Solemnity, in the Ormond
Vault in King Henry the Seventh’s Chapel, the whole
Choir attending, and the Ceremony was perform’d, by
the Right Rev. the Lord Bishop of Rochester and Dean
of Westminster.’</p>

<p>But the popular attention was directed to the other
‘Duke.’ Whatever Tories may have said at the time,
or people generally, since that period as to the character
of the Duke of Cumberland, he was the popular
hero from the moment he arrived in London, after the
victory at Culloden. The papers were full of his
praises. They lauded not only his valour but his
piety. After the battle, so they said, he had gone
unattended over the battle-field, and he was not only
seen in profound meditation, but was heard to exclaim,—his
hands on his breast, and his eyes raised to
heaven—‘Lord! what am I that I should be spared,
when so many brave men lie dead upon the spot?’
Even Scotsmen have owned that the duke attributed
his victory to God, alone, and that he was unmoved by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
the adulation of that large body of Englishmen who
were grateful at having been relieved by him from a
great danger. They compared him with the Black
Prince, who won the day at Poictiers, when he was
about the same age as the duke, when <em>he</em> triumphed
at Culloden. The latter was then in his twenty-sixth
year.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE QUESTION OF INHUMANITY.</i></div>

<p>The orderly-books of the Duke of Cumberland, recently
published, fail to confirm the reports of his
cruelty after Culloden. The Jacobites exaggerated his
severity, and they gave the provocation. That an
order was given to the Highlanders to refuse quarter to
the troops under the Duke of Cumberland is proved
by Wolfe’s well-known letter. The only trace of retaliatory
rigour is to be found in the following entry in
the above book (Maclachlan’s ‘William Augustus, Duke
of Cumberland,’ p. 293): ‘Inverness, April 17th.—The
‘Officers next from Duty to come from Camp, in
order to divide and search the Town for Rebels, their
effects, stores, and baggage. A Captain and 50 Men
to march immediately to the field of Battle, and search
all cottages in the neighbourhood for Rebels. The
Officers and Men will take notice that the public orders
of the Rebels yesterday were to give us no quarter.’
In Wolfe’s letter (he was then on the staff, and one of
Hawley’s aides-de-camp), written on the day the above
order was issued, that young officer says: ‘Orders
were publicly given in the rebel army, the day before
the action, that no quarter should be given to our
troops.’ The latter, it is equally true, had said on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
leaving London for the North that they would neither
give nor take quarter; but they had no orders to such
cruel effect. It was soldierly swagger. At the very
outset, what savagery there was, was fostered by the
London gentlemen who lived at home at ease. Walpole
suggested if Cumberland were sent against the
Jacobite army, ‘it should not be with that sword of
Mercy with which the present Family have governed
their people. Can rigour be displaced against bandits?’
But, if the young duke should be full of compassion
after victory, Walpole rejoiced to think that in General
Hawley there was a military magistrate of some fierceness,
who would not sow the seeds of disloyalty by
too easily pardoning the rebels.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>INSTIGATORS OF CRUELTY.</i></div>

<p>It was said in the London newspapers that the
French did not act at the Battle of Culloden, by reason
of their being made acquainted with the order of giving
no quarter to our troops; and that the French Commanding
Officer declared that rather ‘than comply with
such a Resolution he would resign himself and Troops
into the Hands of the Duke of Cumberland; for his
directions were to fight and not to commit Murder.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE PRISONERS IN LONDON.</i></div>

<p>While London was awaiting the return of the hero,
whose triumphs had already been celebrated, the anti-Jacobites
were disappointed by being deprived of
greeting in their rough way the arrival of the captured
rebel lords. As early, indeed, as November 1745,
Charles Radcliffe (calling himself Lord Derwentwater)
had been taken with his son on board the ‘Soleil,’
bound for Scotland and high treason, and these had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
been got into the Tower, at peril to their lives. But
others were expected. The Earl of Cromartie and his
son, Lord Macleod, had been taken at Dunrobin the
day before Culloden. The Earl of Kilmarnock had
been captured in the course of the fight; Lord Balmerino
a day or two after. The old Marquis of Tullibardine,
who had been in the fray of ’15, the attempt
in ’19, and had escaped after both, missed now his old
luck; <em>that</em> passed to his brother, Lord George Murray,
who got clear off to the Continent. Lord Tullibardine
being sorely pressed and in great distress, sought the
house of Buchanan of Drummakill. It is a question
whether Tullibardine asked asylum or legally surrendered
himself. In either case, he was given up. The
above lords were despatched to London by sea in two
separate voyages. Thus they were spared the insults
undergone thirty years before by Lord Derwentwater
and his unfortunate companions. On June 29th, Walpole
writes: ‘Lady Cromartie went down <em>incog.</em> to Woolwich
to see her son pass by, without the power of
speaking to him. I never heard a more melancholy
instance of affection.’ Lord Elcho, who had escaped,
solicited a pardon; but, says Walpole, ‘as he has distinguished
himself beyond all the rebel commanders by
brutality and insults and cruelty to our prisoners, I
think he is likely to remain where he is.’ Walpole
was of opinion that the young Chevalier was allowed
to escape. He also says: ‘The duke gave Brigadier
Mordaunt the Pretender’s coach, on condition he rode
up to London in it. “That I will, sir,” said he, “and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
drive till it stops of its own accord at the Cocoa Tree”—the
Jacobite Coffee House in St. James’s Street.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE DUKE IN ABERDEEN.</i></div>

<p>With leafy June came the duke; but before him
arrived his baggage. When that baggage which the
duke and General Hawley brought with them from
Scotland was unpacked in London, the articles of
which it consisted must have excited some surprise.
To show what it was, it is necessary to go northward
to the house of Mr. Thompson, advocate, in the Great
Row, Aberdeen. The duke had his quarters in that
house, after his state entry into the granite city, in
February 1746. Six weeks were the Thompsons constrained
to bear with their illustrious but unprofitable
lodger. They had to supply him with coals, candles,
the rich liquids in the advocate’s cellars, and all the
milk of his sole cow. The bed and table linen was
both used and abused. The duke is even charged
with breaking up a press which was full of sugar, of
which he requisitioned every grain. At the end of the
six weeks, when about to march from the city, the
duke left among the three servants of the house as many
guineas. This was not illiberal; but Mr. and Mrs.
Thompson were chiefly aggrieved by his Highness’s lack
of courtesy. He went away without asking to see them,
or leaving any acknowledgment of their hospitality by
sending even a curt thank ye! General Hawley behaved
even more rudely in the house of Mrs. Gordon of Hallhead.
Before he took possession it was understood that
everything was to be locked up, and that the general
was only to have the use of the furniture. This gallant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
warrior, as soon as he had flung his plumed hat on the
table, demanded the keys.
<span class="sni"><i>LOOTING.</i></span>
Much disputation followed,
with angry squabbling, and the keys were only given up
on the general’s threat that he would smash every lock
in the house. The yielding came too late. General and
duke together declared all the property of Mrs. Gordon
to be confiscated, except the clothes she wore. ‘Your
loyalty, Madam,’ said Major Wolfe to her, ‘is not suspected;’
which made the poor lady only the more
perplexed as to why she was looted. The major
politely offered to endeavour to get restored to her
any article she particularly desired to recover. ‘I
should like to have all my tea back,’ said Mrs. Gordon.
‘It is good tea,’ said the major. ‘Tea is scarce in the
army. I do not think it recoverable.’ It was the same
with the chocolate and many other things agreeable to
the stomach. ‘At all events,’ said the lady, ‘let me
have my china again!’ ‘It is very pretty china,’ replied
the provoking major, ‘there is a good deal of it;
and we are fond of china ourselves; but, we have no
ladies travelling with us. I think you should have some
of the articles.’ Mrs. Gordon, however, obtained
nothing. She petitioned the duke, and he promised
restitution; but, says the lady herself, ‘when I sent for
a pair of breeches for my son, for a little tea for myself,
for a bottle of ale, for some flour to make bread, because
there was none to be bought in the town, all was
refused me!’ ‘In fact, Hawley, on the eve of his
departure,’ Mrs. Gordon tells us, ‘packed up every bit
of china I had, all my bedding and table linen, every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
book, my repeating clock, my worked screen, every rag
of my husband’s clothes, the very hat, breeches, night-gown,
shoes, and what shirts there were of the child’s;
twelve tea-spoons, strainer and tongs, the japanned
board on which the chocolate and coffee cups stood;
and he put them on board a ship in the night time.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE DUKE AND HIS PLUNDER.</i></div>

<p>Out of this miscellaneous plunder, a tea equipage
and a set of coloured table china, addressed to the
Duke of Cumberland at St. James’s, reached their
destination. With what face his Highness could show
to his London friends the valuable china he had stolen
from a lady whose loyalty, he allowed, was above suspicion,
defies conjecture. The spoons, boy’s shirts,
breeches, and meaner trifles, were packed up under
an address to General Hawley, London. ‘A house so
plundered,’ wrote the lady, ‘I believe was never heard
of. It is not 600<abbr title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr> would make up my loss; nor have
I at this time a single table-cloth, napkin, or towel, teacup,
glass, or any one convenience.’ One can hardly
believe that any but the more costly articles reached
London. Moreover, whatever censure the Londoners
may have cast upon the plunderers, the duke was not
very ill thought of by the Aberdeen authorities. When
the duke was perhaps sipping his tea from the cups, or
banquetting his friends at St. James’s off Mrs. Gordon’s
dinner-service, a deputation from Aberdeen brought
to his Highness the ‘freedom’ of the city, with many
high compliments on the bravery and good conduct of
the victor at Culloden!</p>

<p>The duke got tired of his tea-set. He is said to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
have presented it to one of the daughters of husseydom,
and the damsel sold it to a dealer in such things. A
friend of Mrs. Gordon’s saw the set exposed for sale
in the dealer’s window, and on inquiry he learnt,
from the dealer himself, through what clean hands it
had come into his possession.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A HUMAN HEAD.</i></div>

<p>If report might be credited the Duke of Cumberland
brought with him to London, and in his own
carriage, a human head, which he believed to be that
of Charles Edward! Young Roderick Mackenzie called
to the soldiers who shot him down in the Braes of
Glenmorristen, ‘Soldiers, you have killed your lawful
prince!’ These words, uttered to divert pursuit from
the young Chevalier, were believed, and when Roderick
died, the soldiers cut off his head and brought it
to the Duke of Cumberland’s quarters. Robert Chambers,
in his ‘History of the Rebellion,’ qualifies with
an ‘<em>it is said</em>’ the story that the duke stowed away the
head in his chaise, and carried it to London. Dr.
Chambers adds, as a fact, that Richard Morrison,
Charles Edward’s body-servant, and a prisoner at Carlisle,
was sent for to London, as the best witness to
decide the question of identity. Morrison fainted at
this trial of his feelings; but regaining composure, he
looked steadily at the relic, and declared that it was
not the head of his beloved master.</p>

<div class="sidenote">‘<i>SWEET WILLIAM.</i>’</div>

<p>But all minor matters were forgotten in the general
joy. Now the duke was back in person, loyal London went
mad about ‘the son of George, the image of Nassau!’
Flattery, at once flowery and poetical, was heaped upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
him. A flower once dedicated to William <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> was
now dedicated to him. The white rose in a man’s
button-hole or on a lady’s bosom, in the month of June,
was not greater warranty of a Jacobite than the
‘Sweet-William,’ with its old appropriate name, was
of a Whig to the back-bone. Of the poetical homage,
here is a <span class="lock">sample:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">The pride of France is lily-white,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The rose in June is Jacobite;</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">’Tis English growth of beauteous hue,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Clothed, like our troops, in red and blue.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No plant with brighter lustre grows,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Except the laurel on his brows.</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>FLATTERY.</i></div>

<p class="unindent">Poetasters converted Horace’s laudation of Augustus
into flattery of Cumberland. Fables were written in
which sweet William served at once for subject and
for moral. Epigrams from Martial, or from a worse
source—the writers’ own brains—were fresh but bluntly
pointed in his favour. Some of them compared him
to the sun, at whose warmth ‘vermin cast off their
coats and took wing.’ Others raised him far above
great Julius; for Cumberland ‘conquers, coming; and
before he sees.’ Sappho, under the name of <em>Clarinda</em>,
told the world, on hearing a report of the duke’s illness,
that if Heaven took him, it would be the death of
her, and that the world would lose a Hero and a Maid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
together. Heroic writers, trying Homer’s strain, and
not finding themselves equal to it, blamed poor Homer,
and declared that the strings of his lyre were too weak
to bear the strain of the modern warrior’s praise. Occasional
prologues hailed him as ‘the martial boy,’ on the
day he entered his twenty-sixth year. Pinchbeck struck
a medal in his honour; punsters in coffee-houses rang
the changes on <em>metal</em> and <em>mettle</em>, and Pinchbeck became
almost as famous for the medal as he subsequently became
for his invention of new candle-snuffers, when
the poets besought him to ‘snuff the candle of the
state, which burned a little blue.’ In fine, ballads,
essays, apologues, prose and poetry, were exhausted
in furnishing homage to the hero. The homage culminated
when the duke’s portrait appeared in all the
shops, bearing the inscription, ‘<span class="smcap">Ecce Homo!</span>’</p>

summon a jury for the trial of the prisoners, at the
Court House, in Southwark, a very equivocal compliment
was paid to Richmond. The grand jury were
selected from among the inhabitants of Addiscombe,
Bermondsey, Camberwell, Clapham, Croydon, Kennington,
Lambeth, Putney, Rotherhithe, Southwark,—but
not from Richmond, or its immediate neighbourhood.
The inhabitants of that courtly locality were spared.
They were supposed to be thoroughly Hanoverian, and
therefore to a certain degree biassed! The trials of
those called ‘the Manchester officers’ divided the
attention of London with those of the Jacobite peers.
The former were brought to the Court House, St.
Margaret’s Hill, Southwark, on July 3rd, for arraignment.
The judges in commission were Chief Justice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
Lee, Justices Wright, Dennison, Foster, and Abney;
Barons Clive and Reynolds, with two magistrates, Sir
Thomas De Viel and Peter Theobald, Esqs. Eighteen
prisoners were brought to the Court through an excited
and insulting mob. Of these eighteen, five pleaded
‘guilty.’ The trials of the remaining thirteen were
deferred to the 13th July. Of these, one was acquitted.
<span class="sni"><i>COLONEL TOWNELEY.</i></span>
The first prisoner placed at the bar was Francis Towneley,
Colonel of the Manchester regiment, and nephew
of the Towneley who had such a narrow escape of the
gallows for his share in the earlier outbreak. The
trials so nearly resembled each other, that to narrate
a few will afford a sample of the whole. The Attorney-General
(Ryder), the Solicitor-General (Murray), Sir
John Strange, Sir Richard Lloyd, and the Hon. Mr.
Yorke were the prosecuting counsel. Towneley was
defended by Sergeant Wynne and Mr. Clayton. The
addresses of the king’s counsel altogether would make
but a short speech, in the present day. One briefly
explained the charge; and the others, among them,
expressed their horror at the rebel idea of overturning
so glorious a throne and so gracious a king. They
laughed at the motto on the rebel flag: <em>Liberty,
Property, and King</em>. Liberty was interpreted as meaning
slavery; property meant plunder; and king, an
usurper who was to sit in the place of a murdered and
rightful monarch. Seven witnesses deposed against
Towneley. The first two were ‘rebels’ who, to save
their necks, turned traitors. The first, Macdonald,
swore to his having seen Towneley acting as colonel of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
the Manchester regiment with a white cockade in his
hat, a Highland dress, a plaid sash, sword and pistols.
The cross-examination was as brief as that in chief.
Out of it came that Macdonald expected his pardon for
his testimony; that he was only a servant; was brought
by sea and came ashore from the Thames in a destitute
condition, and had nothing to subsist on.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>KING’S EVIDENCE.</i></div>

<p>Macdonald’s fellow in iniquity, Maddox, succeeded.
He was nominally an ensign, but he held no commission,
and Towneley was his colonel. In the retreat,
northward, Maddox stated that he had expressed a
desire to get back to his master at Manchester, and
that Towneley replied that, if he attempted to withdraw,
he would have his brains knocked out. At
Carlisle, he added, the Pretender, on leaving, appointed
Towneley Commandant, under Hamilton, the Governor
of the town. That, in the above capacity, Towneley
fortified the city, sent out foraging parties, to whom
he made signals by firing a pistol as he stood on the
wall, to warn them against surprises by the enemy.
When Governor Hamilton spoke of surrendering the
citadel, Towneley, according to Maddox, flew into
violent rage, and protested that ‘it would be better to
die by the sword than to fall into the hands of the
damned Hanoverians.’ In his cross-examination, Maddox
accounted for his being an approver, by saying:
‘My brother came to me in the New Prison, and advised
me to do my best to save my own life, and serve
my country.’ He had followed the fraternal counsel,
and was then living, at Government cost, in a messenger’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
house.
<span class="sni"><i>TOWNELEY’S TRIAL.</i></span>
The third approver, Coleman, gave similar
evidence. A Carlisle grocer, Davidson, deposed
that he heard Colonel Towneley give orders to set fire
to a house near the city, from which ‘the Elector of
Hanover’s troops’ had fired on some Jacobite soldiery.
Two captains, Nevet and Vere, stated, that on entering
Carlisle, they had found Towneley acting as Commandant;
and Captain Carey said, that the Duke of Cumberland
having ordered him, through Lord Beauclerc,
to take the rebel officers under his guard, he found on
Towneley some guineas and a watch, ‘which I did not
take from him,’ the captain added; ‘for His Royal
Highness’s orders were, not to take any money out of
the pockets of any of the officers, as it might be of
service in their confinement.’</p>

<p>The process of accusation was not long; the defence
was briefer still. Towneley’s counsel could not
save him by stating that he was a gentleman by birth
and education; that motives which weighed upon him
forced him to go abroad in 1722; that he held a commission
from the King of France; and that he was at
the side of Borwick, when that marshal was slain at
Phillipsburgh; that he had come over to England,
some time before, while in the service of the French
king; and that, as a French officer, he had ‘a right to
the cartel.’ Captain Carpenter, whose evidence was
to the same effect, served the colonel as little by his
deposition; and two Manchester men, Hayward and
Dickinson, who swore that Maddox was a cheating
apprentice to a Manchester apothecary, not to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
believed on his oath, might as well have remained at
home.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CONVICTION.</i></div>

<p>The summing-up was brief, but to the purpose.
The jury, consisting of three gentlemen, one yeoman,
three brewers, a baker, brazier, starch-maker, gardener,
and cloth-worker, promptly replied to it, by finding
Towneley ‘guilty.’ The colonel heard the word and
the sentence which followed, so horrible in its details
of strangling and burning, without being much moved.
His dignity never failed him; and the crowd through
which he returned to his dungeon was less savage, in
its expletives, than the loyal press in its comments.
‘The commission from the French king,’ said the
‘Penny Post,’ ‘was treated with the contempt it deserved,
and must convince the Jacobites that such foolish
and wicked contrivances can have no effect on men
of understanding.’ ‘Hear! hear!’ cried the Whig
papers; ‘so much for the nominal Colonel!’</p>

<p>While these trials were in progress, a curious enquiry
was attracting not a few of ‘the mobile’ to
another part of the town. A goodly number of King
George’s soldiers were made prisoners by the Jacobites,
at the battle of Preston Pans. These had been recovered,
but they did not return to the ranks unquestioned.
They were compelled to appear, in batches, at Hicks’s
Hall, Clerkenwell, to clear themselves from the imputation
of cowardice and desertion; and to undergo the
rough wit of the populace as they went to and fro.
Other soldiers, against whom the above imputation
could not be laid, offended in another way. For acts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
of murderous violence and robbery in the London
streets, six soldiers were hung on the same day, at
Tyburn. As long as such spectacles were provided,
the mob little cared to which side the victims belonged.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CAPTAIN FLETCHER.</i></div>

<p>Three prisoners were tried on the following day,
July 16th, Fletcher, Chadwick, and Battragh. Maddox,
the approver, stated, as in Towneley’s case, that he had
expressed a wish to withdraw, but that Fletcher had
said: ‘That it would be a scandalous shame to retreat;’
and, added the witness, ‘putting his hand in his pocket,
he pulled out a great purse of gold, and told me I
should not want while that lasted! I have seen him
in the assembly with ladies, he was a chapman and
dealt in linen before this affair.’ Bradbury, another
witness, said, ‘When the recruiting sergeant had
finished his speech, at Manchester, with “God save King
James and Prince Charles!” Captain Fletcher pulled off
his hat and hallooed.’ For the defence, Anne Aston,
an old servant of seven and twenty years’ standing,
stated that Fletcher carefully managed his mother’s
business at Salford; that he was always loyal, but that
the Jacobites had carried him off by force, from the
house, and that he went away weeping. It was, however,
said that he gave 50<abbr title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr> for his captain’s commission.
He was found <em>guilty</em>, was again put in fetters,
and was taken back to prison. ‘I would do it again!’
was his bold remark, as he turned away from the bar.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE MANCHESTER OFFICERS.</i></div>

<p>Lieutenant Chadwick and Ensign Battragh were
then put forward. They belonged to Captain James
Dawson’s company. The ensign had been an attorney’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
clerk. The lieutenant was the son of a Manchester
tallow-chandler and soap-boiler, but he was too
proud to follow his sire’s calling. He was a handsome
fellow, with a sweet voice for singing, and was no
mean proficient on the organ. ‘He kept,’ it was said,
‘some of the most polite company in the place, and
never followed any trade.’ One of the witnesses stated
that when the lieutenant was with the Jacobite army
at Lancaster, he went into the organ-loft of one of the
churches and played ‘the King shall have his own
again!’ In addition to the old witnesses, a Jacobite
drummer-boy, twelve years old, was called. ‘Child,’
said the judge, ‘do you know the nature of an oath?’
The child readily answered in the affirmative, adding:
‘I know I am sworn to speak the truth, and I shall
never be happy if I don’t.’ Upon this, he was sworn,
and he deposed to being a servant to Captain Lowther,
and to being taken prisoner at Carlisle, where, said he,
‘I begged my life on my knees, of His Royal Highness,
which he readily granted, and God bless him for it!’
The active presence of both prisoners in the rebel army
having been duly proved, they held their peace, and
were duly found guilty, were ironed, and carried back
to their dungeons.</p>

<div class="sidenote">‘<i>JEMMY DAWSON.</i>’</div>

<p>Lieutenant-Colonel Deacon, Captain Berwick, and
Captain James Dawson stood successively at the bar, on
the 17th July. Deacon was the son of a Manchester
physician, and long before the Jacobites entered Manchester,
he had proclaimed his intention of joining
them. This he did with two brothers; one, a mere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
boy, was captured, detained, and ultimately released.
The other was slain. Berwick (who was familiarly
dignified with the titular honour of ‘Duke’) was a gay
young fellow who had dealt in ‘chequered linens,’ but
had not been ‘prudent’ in trade; and had joined the
rebels to escape his creditors. The third rebel, ‘Jemmy
Dawson,’ has become better known to us than either
‘brave Berwick,’ or ‘gallant Deacon.’ He was a
‘Lancashire lad,’ of good family. He was so fond of
what is also called ‘good company,’ when he was at
St. John’s, Cambridge, that he withdrew from his
college, in order to escape expulsion. He returned to
Manchester, where he lived ‘on his fortune and his
friends.’—‘He was always a mighty gay gentleman,’ it
was said at his trial, ‘and frequented much the company
of ladies, and was well respected by all his acquaintances
of either sex, for his genteel deportment.’</p>

<p>The usual testimony was given against the three
Jacobites. Maddox added, of Deacon, that he had seen
him sitting at the ‘Bull’s Head,’ Manchester, taking
the names of the recruits, and also making up blue and
white ribbons into bows, to decorate the recruits with.
On the march, he seems to have indulged in making
long speeches, praising ‘Charles, Prince Regent,’ and
inducing many to join, on assurance of good treatment
when they got to London, or five guineas wherewith
to get home again. He was very conspicuous in his
plaid suit, with laced loops, broad sword, and pistols.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE JACOBITE PRESS.</i></div>

<p>There was some variety on the 18th at the trial of
a Welsh barrister named David Morgan. ‘I waited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
on him at Preston,’ said one Tew, ‘when he and Lord
Elcho dined together. They talked on the Pretender’s
affairs. Morgan asked of what religion the prince
might be, and Lord Elcho replied that his religion
was yet to seek.’ Other witnesses deposed to Morgan’s
active participation in the rebellion, the consideration
with which he was treated by other officers, and his
close attendance upon the Pretender, by whose side
he rode out of Derby on a bay horse. Captain Vere,
who had received his surrender, said, ‘He called me
a great scoundrel, as I prevented gentlemen getting
commissions under Sir Daniel O’Carrol.’ Another
witness deposed that he had gone the night before
out of curiosity to see Morgan in Newgate, and that
this Pretender’s counsellor had actually exclaimed,
‘We shall soon be in Derby again, in spite of King
George or anybody else!’ Morgan’s defence was
that he had repented, and had tried to escape, but
was arrested. The Solicitor-General remarked that
the attempt was not made till the cause was desperate,
and Morgan was pronounced ‘Guilty!’</p>

<p>The trials and sentences impressed the writers of
the London newspapers in various ways. The ‘happy
establishment’ supporters thirsted for rebel blood.
The Jacobite journals were ‘cowed.’ They seemed
even afraid to express a hope that mercy might be
extended to the condemned officers. The utmost
they ventured to do was to suggest mercy, or keep
a thought of it alive in the breast of princes and
people, by selecting Shakespeare for their advocate;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
and in these journals might be read again and again
the lines from ‘Measure for <span class="lock">Measure’:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">But Shakespeare pleaded and suggested in vain.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE CONDEMNED JACOBITES.</i></div>

<p>After sentence the Jacobite officers were heavily
ironed, even by day. At night they were fastened to
the floor by a staple. Colonel Towneley was speedily
interviewed by a ‘good-natured friend,’ who, in the
spirit of one of Job’s comforters, remarked: ‘I believe,
Sir, you deceived yourself in imagining you should be
able to clear up your innocence; ... and that you
was not quite right in supposing that you could invalidate
the credit of the king’s witnesses.’ Tears for the
first and last time came into the colonel’s eyes.
Towneley said simply, ‘I never thought it could have
come to this.’ The remark may have referred to his
weakness rather than to his fate. In the disorderly
prison, when hopes of reprieve caused some to sing
hysterically, and to drink in much the same spirit,
Towneley never lost his grave and becoming dignity.
His reserve when he, for an hour, came from his room
into the yard was looked upon by the hilarious and untried
Jacobite prisoners as insolent contempt. This did
not affect the colonel, who communed only with himself,
and passed on without remark.
<span class="sni"><i>PAINFUL PARTINGS.</i></span>
In order, however,
that he might die like a gentleman as well as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
a Christian, a tailor measured him for a suit of black
velvet, in which he might appear with dignity on the
day of his execution. Young Fletcher never lost
his cheerfulness, except, perhaps, when he alluded to
his ‘poor mother’ having offered him 1,000<abbr title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr> not to
join the rebel army. ‘Here I am,’ said the young
fellow, ‘for which I have nobody to thank but myself.’
Blood refused to trust, as his friends did, in a reprieve.
‘I can die but once,’ he replied to their remarks; ‘as
well now as at any other time. I am ready.’ ‘My
father,’ said the valiant barber, Syddal, ‘was put to
death for joining the Stuarts in ’15. I am about to
follow him for joining them in ’45. I have five
children; may none of them fall in a worse cause!’
Two fathers had interviews on the eve of the execution,
with their sons. ‘Jemmy Dawson’ and Chadwick had
displayed the utmost unobtrusive fortitude. ‘You
may put tons of iron on me,’ said the former young
captain, when he was being heavily fettered after judgment:
‘it will not in the least damp my resolution.’
Chadwick had manifested a similar spirit; but when
the two lads were held for the last time each in his
weeping father’s arms, resolution temporarily gave
way. The parting scene was of a most painful nature.
Poor Syddal, the Jacobite barber, behaved with as
much propriety as any of higher rank. Morgan, the
lawyer, was irritable, and on the very eve of being
hanged quarrelled with the charges made by the prison
cook for indifferent fare.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>WITHIN PRISON-WALLS.</i></div>

<p>Among the untried prisoners there was one Bradshaw,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
in whom there seems to have been a touch of
the insanity which was afterwards pleaded in his
defence. This gay, thoughtless fellow hated Towneley,
with whom he had quarrelled at Carlisle, ‘on account,’
say the newspapers, ‘of a young lady whom they had
severally addressed at a ball which was kept at the
Bull’s Head Inn, Manchester, for the neighbouring
gentry.’ This trifle seems to show what feather-brained
gallants some of the <a id="chg4"></a>Jacobite officers were. The
quarrel about a pretty girl was never made up. On
the day before the sentence was carried out, Bradshaw
shuffled up in his fetters to Colonel Towneley in the
yard, and saluted his former superior officer with,
‘I find, sir, you must shortly march into other
quarters.’ Towneley looked at him in silent surprise,
but Berwick, who was at the colonel’s side, spiritedly
remarked: ‘Jemmy, you should not triumph at our
misfortunes. You may depend upon it, mocking is
catching;’ and turning to Chadwick, who had not yet
been summoned to meet his fate, Berwick rejoined:
‘Bradshaw has no pity in him.’ Chadwick looked
at the pitiless scoffer, who had been drinking freely
(prison rules set no limit to tippling), and said: ‘What
could be expected of such a fellow? He is a disgrace
to our army.’ At length on their last evening came
the hour for locking up. As the doomed Jacobites
were being stapled to the floor, some of them ordered
that they should be called at six in the morning, and
that coffee should be ready for them when they descended
to the yard. They were wide awake, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
at that hour; but when the fastidious Morgan
heard that the coffee was ready before he was released
from the staple, he flew into a furious passion, and,
within an hour or two of being hanged, drawn, and
quartered, this irascible Jacobite made a heavy grievance
of having to drink his coffee half cold!</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE LAST MORNING.</i></div>

<p>Before they descended to the yard the three sledges
were drawn up there, in which the nine Jacobites were
to be drawn, by threes, to the gallows, the quartering
block, and the fire, at the place of sacrifice. Prisoners
whose hour had not yet come were curiously
inspecting these gloomy vehicles. Bradshaw, with his
morning brandy in his brains, affected much curiosity
in the matter, and his doings were watched, like the
performance of a mime, by idle gentlemen who had
walked in, without let or hindrance, to the spectacle.
It was raining heavily, but that was no obstacle to the
acting. Bradshaw inspected the sledges, and pronounced
them very proper for the purposes for which
they were designed. Then he raked about the straw,
declared there was too little of it, and bade the
warders to procure more, or ‘the lads’ would get their
feet wet.</p>

<p>The ‘lads’ took their last coffee in a room off the
yard, generally in silence. Chadwick alone made a
remark to Berwick: ‘Ah, Duke,’ he said, ‘our time
draws near, but I feel in good heart.’ ‘I, too,’
answered Berwick; ‘death does not shock me in the
least. My friends forgive me, and have done their
best to save me. May God be merciful to us all!’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
And then appeared the governor with, ‘Now, gentlemen,
if you please!’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>VIA DOLOROSA.</i></div>

<p>The gentlemen were ready at the call. Their irons
were knocked off before they entered the sledges, and
each was slightly pinioned—so slightly that Syddal
took advantage of it to take snuff, whereby to cover
a little natural nervousness. Behind the sledges followed
a coach, in which, under the guard of a warder,
the younger Deacon lay rather than sat. His youth
had saved his life. The parting of the two brothers
was most touching, and the younger one implored that
he might suffer too. He suffered more, for he was
condemned to witness the sufferings of his brother.
The mob between the prison and Kennington Common
was enormous, in spite of the pitiless rain. At the
period of the trials, when the Jacobite prisoners passed
to and fro, the mob treated them in the most ruffianly
manner; but now, on their way to death, not even a word
of offence was flung at them. The crowd gazed at the
doomed men and the heavy escort of horse and foot
in sympathising silence.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>AT KENNINGTON COMMON.</i></div>

<p>At the gallows tree there was neither priest, nor
minister, nor prison ordinary, to give spiritual aid.
Singular incidents ensued. The captives could scarcely
have been pinioned at all. Morgan took out a book
of devotion, and read it full half an hour to his
fellows in misery, who stood around him, gravely
listening. Syddal and Deacon read speeches, which
were word for word identical. They were, in fact,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
addresses said to be written by a nonjuring minister, one
Creake, and printed for circulation in the crowd. The
purport was, that the two culprits professed to belong
to neither the Church of England nor of Rome, but to
a poor episcopal church that had cured the errors of
all other modern churches. They were further made
to say that one universal church was the only perfect
principle; and they recommended a perusal of a work
called ‘A Complete Collection of Devotion, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1734,’
which was believed to be by Dr. Deacon, the father of
one of the condemned. Morgan appears to have really
spoken. He abused the Church of Rome, which was
rather ungracious at such a moment, in Towneley’s
presence, who, however, never uttered a word in reply.
Morgan declared he was a Church of England man
(the anti-Jacobite journals denounced him as an unmitigated
miscreant), and that his faith was set forth
in two works: ‘The Christian Test,’ and, he added,
‘in a work to be hereafter published by my most dutiful
daughter, Miss Mary Morgan.’ The other sufferers
observed silence, but all, before they died, manfully
declared that they died willingly in a just cause, and
that their deaths would be avenged. One or two
threw papers into the crowd; one or two their gold-laced
hats—which must have disgusted the hangmen,
who were thus deprived of part of their perquisites.
Others, it is said, flung to the mob their prayer-books,
which were found to be turned down at the 89th
Psalm, from the 21st verse to the end, which passages
will be found, not, indeed, altogether inapplicable, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
needing some little violence to make the application
suit the circumstances.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>EXECUTION.</i></div>

<p>Next followed the unutterable barbarity of the
execution; where, however, the strangling rendered
the sufferers above all consciousness of the butcher’s
knife, and the flames. The mob had time to notice
that the twist of the halters were alternately white and
red. The rope-maker, much urged to explain, gave no
other answer than that it was his fancy. The crowd,
at the close, had to make way for a coach which had
been drawn up by the side of the scaffold. It contained
the poor lad, Deacon, condemned to see his
elder brother die. Thence, probably, has arisen the
romance, which tells us that the coach contained a lady
who had died of her love, and of her horror at the sufferings
of her sweetheart, Dawson, and which afforded
an opportunity to Shenstone to write his well-known
ballad,—‘Jemmy Dawson.’</p>

<p>The Whig Press observed a certain decency in its
comments on the sufferers. Exception, however, was
made in the case of Morgan. ‘What his virtues and
better qualities were,’ said the loyal ‘Penny Post,’—‘if
he had any, have not yet come to our knowledge; if they
had, we should gladly have mentioned them, that the
world might not run away with the opinion that Mr.
Morgan was the only man who ever lived half a century
without doing one good action, and that he died
unlamented by friend, neighbour, or domestic.’ There
is a charming affectation of delicacy in another paragraph,
which runs thus: ‘What his treatment of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
wife has been, we have no business with. He parted
from her with a good deal of seeming affection.’ One
of the journals paid the sufferers as much compliment
as the writer could afford to give under the circumstances:
‘They all behaved,’ he says, ‘with a kind of
fixt resolution of putting the best face they could upon
a Bad Cause, and therefore behaved with Decency and
seeming Resolution.’</p>

<p>At the ‘clearing up,’ it was discovered that the
papers the poor fellows had flung among the crowd,
before they were hanged, were of a highly treasonable
nature. There was eager snatching of them from one
another, and a still hotter eagerness on the part of
the Government to discover the ‘rascal printer.’ He
had audaciously set in type the last expression of the
sufferers,—that they died willingly for their king and
the cause; regretted the brave attempt had failed;—and,
had they the opportunity, they would make the
same attempt, for their king, again. A mob rather
than a group had collected about Temple Bar to see
their heads spiked. Deacon’s and Syddal’s had been
sent to Manchester. When the hangman and his
assistant tripped up the ladder at the bar, each with a
head under his arm, the sympathising spectators were
in doubt as to whose shoulders they had originally
come from. Bets were laid on one, as being certainly
Colonel Towneley’s. There were counter-bets that
Towneley’s had gone to Carlisle. Assertions were made
upon oath—very strong oaths, too,—that Towneley’s
head was then lying with his body at an undertaker’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
up at Pancras, and was to be buried with it. The
hangman was a reserved man, and his comrade was taciturn.
They left the gaping crowd uncertain. One of
the heads was truly Fletcher’s. Was the other Morgan’s?
Information was not supplied by the officials;
but, after consideration, the spectators decided that the
colonel’s head was set up with the captain’s; and this
judgment was never shaken from the popular mind.
A correspondent of ‘Notes and Queries’ (<abbr title="December">Dec.</abbr> 7, 1872,
p. 456), says of the Jacobite colonel: ‘His head is now
in a box, in the library at 12, Charles Street, Berkeley
Square, the residence of the present Colonel Charles
Towneley.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>HEADS AND BODIES.</i></div>

<p>The bodies of the Jacobites executed on Kennington
Common were buried in the parish of St. Pancras.
The headless trunk of Towneley was deposited in a
grave in the old churchyard. Those of Fletcher,
Deacon, Chadwick, Berwick, Syddal, Dawson, Blood,
and Morgan, lie in the burial-ground of the parish, near
the Foundling Hospital. The heads of the last three
were given up to their friends. Syddal’s and Deacon’s
were exposed on the market-cross at Manchester.
Chadwick’s and Berwick’s were sent to Carlisle.</p>

<p>Towneley’s ghost was appeased by a ballad-writer
who brought the spirit to the Duke of Cumberland’s
bed, where the ghost scared him from sleep, charged
him with crimes which he could hardly have committed
in a life time, and so horrified him with a recital
of the retributive pains the victor at Culloden
would suffer in hell, that William rushed, for safety,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>

<div class="sidenote"><i>OTHER TRIALS.</i></div>

<p>One of the most cruel illustrations of the period
has reference to the father of young Captain Deacon.
The captain’s head was sent down to be ‘spiked’ at
Manchester. The father, a nonjuring minister in the
town, always avoided the spot. One day, he involuntarily
came within view of what was to him a holy
relic. He reverently raised his hat on passing it. For
this testimony of respect and affection, he was charged
with sedition, and was fined.</p>

<p>Several of the so-called Jacobite captains and
lieutenants who were subsequently tried, were allowed
their lives (to be passed beyond the Atlantic) on condition
of pleading guilty. Others who stood their trial,
similarly escaped. Alexander Margrowther, a lieutenant,
a well-dressed, active, joyous, hopeful fellow,
protested that he did not join the army of Prince
Charles Edward till after Lord Perth had three times
threatened to lay waste his property and burn his house;
and even then he was carried off against his will. Chief
Justice Lee acknowledged that constraint had been
put upon him, but that his remaining and fighting on
the rebel side was voluntary. The verdict was ‘guilty,’
but execution did not follow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A MAD JACOBITE.</i></div>

<p>The brothers of Sir James Kinloch, Charles and
Alexander, were equally fortunate. Mr. Justice Wright
differed with his judicial brother on a point of law, and
was of opinion that judgment should be arrested.
This saved the dashing pair of brothers from the gallows.
Bradshaw, who came up for trial, October 27th,
appeared at the bar in a gay suit of green; he looked
as confident as his suit looked gay. His presence and
activity in the Pretender’s array at Manchester, Carlisle,
and Culloden, were amply proved; but a plea of insanity
was set up to excuse it. This amounted to little
more than that he was a sleep-walker, was eccentric,
had always been so, and that eccentricity was almost
developed into madness at the death of his wife who
was described as ‘a fine lady whom he had accompanied
to all the gay places of diversion in London.’
He was certainly out of his senses when he left a flourishing
business at Manchester, in order to wear a pair
of epaulettes and a plaid scarf among the Jacobites.
That he quitted Carlisle, instead of surrendering, and
took his chance with the Scots, till the decisive day at
Culloden, was held by the prosecuting lawyers as a proof
that Bradshaw had his senses about him. His courage
failed him when he was adjudged to be hanged on the
28th of November. Some of his friends among the
London Jacobites tried, but in vain, to get him off.
The Whig papers were quite scandalised that even certain
‘city ald—rm—n’ had petitioned for a pardon for
this once defiant, insolent, and impetuous rebel.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>SIR JOHN WEDDERBURN.</i></div>

<p>If Bradshaw excited some interest in the City aldermen,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
there was a Sir John Wedderburn, Bart., who
found sympathy in men of both parties. His father, a
stout Whig, had been at the head of the excise, in the
Port of Dundee. Old Sir John had an ample estate,
but being of a liberal and generous spirit, as the contemporary
press remarks, his liberality and generosity
utterly ruined his family. At his death there was no
estate for his heirs to inherit. The new baronet, with
his wife and family, took up his residence near Perth,
in a thatched hut, with a clay floor, and no light except
what came through the doorway. It was placed on a
very small bit of land from which Sir John could not
be ousted. He tilled his half acre with ceaseless industry,
and he made what was described as ‘a laborious
but starving shift’ to support his wife and nine children.
They all went about barefoot. To the head of
this family, a proposal was made, when the Jacobites
occupied Perth, that he should collect all dues and imposts
for Prince Charles Edward. Sir John’s poverty
consented. He collected the taxes, but he never joined
the Jacobite army. Nevertheless, when the army under
the Duke of Cumberland came that way, Sir John was
seized and sent south. Put upon his trial, he pleaded
his poverty, his starving family, and his light offence.
He was however condemned, though more guilty offenders
had unaccountably escaped. He bore himself
with a calm dignity till the adverse verdict was pronounced,
and then he could not completely control an
emotion which sprung rather from thoughts of his
family, than for himself. The lowest and loyalest of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
the Londoners acknowledged that Sir John Wedderburn
was a gentleman and deserving of pity. After his
death, the king afforded pecuniary relief to his wife
and family.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>‘BISHOP’ COPPOCK.</i></div>

<p>Some of these unfortunate Jacobites manifested a
dauntless bravery which almost amounted to absence of
proper feeling. Coppock was one of them. Charles
Edward had nominated this reverend gentleman to the
bishopric of Carlisle. Leaving the bar, after sentence of
death, with a doomed and somewhat terrified fellow
prisoner,—‘What the devil are you afraid of?’ said the
prelate; ‘we sha’n’t be tried by a Cumberland Jury in
the next world.’</p>

<span class="smcap">uring</span> the summer, the parks had special
attractions for the public. The tactics
which were supposed to have won Culloden
were ordered to be followed in the
army. Consequently, the twenty-eight companies forming
the First Regiment of Foot Guards were exercised
in Hyde Park, by General Folliot, half of idle London
looking on. ‘They went through their firing,’ as the
papers reported, ‘four deep, with their bayonets fixed,
as at the late battle near Culloden House, and performed
the exercise, though quite new to them, exceeding well.’
Then, there was a little spectacle in the presentation to
General St. Clair of a sword which had been taken from
the Earl of Cromartie. When the earl possessed this
weapon, the blade bore two inscriptions: ‘God preserve
King James <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> of Scotland!’ and ‘Prosperity to
Scotland, and No Union!’ For these were substituted
‘God preserve King George <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>, King of Great Britain,
France and Ireland!’ and ‘Prosperity to England
and Scotland!’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>AT THE WHIPPING POSTS.</i></div>

<p>All military sights did not go off so pleasantly as the
above. There is record of a soldier being shot by an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
undiscovered comrade in the new Culloden exercise.
There is also the chronicling of the sentence of death
having been passed on fifty-six deserters, who declined
further service under King George. On being reprieved,
they were paraded in St. James’s Park, for
the public scorn, perhaps for the public sympathy.
Thence, the Londoners saw them marched, under a
strong guard, on their way to Portsmouth. They
arrived there footsore, but the loyal folk refused to
give them the refreshment which was generally offered
to troops on the march and about to embark for war
service abroad. These deserters were destined for
Cape Breton, for ‘General Frampton’s regiment,’ a
position celebrated for its power of using up all consigned
to it. There were worse characters left behind.
So disloyal and riotous were parts of the Westminster
populace that the magistrates adorned several of the
streets with new Whipping Posts. When constables
heard a disloyal cry, or fancied they did, or had a
loyal spite against a poor devil, they had him up to
a Whipping Post, in a trice, dealt with him there in
ruffianly fashion, and then took the patient before a
magistrate to see if he deserved it. While too outspoken
Jacobites and the ruffians of no particular politics
were exhibited as patients at the Whipping Posts,
the Pugilists took Whiggery by the arm and taught it
the noble art of self-defence. Mr. Hodgkins, a great
bruiser, fencer, and single-stick player of that day,
loyally advertised that he was ‘fully resolved to maintain
his school gratis to all well-wishers of King George<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
and Duke William, that they may know how to maintain
their cutlass against their enemies.’</p>

<p>All this while, arraigners and hangmen were kept
in great professional activity. While rebel officers and
men were being tried at Southwark and hanged at
Kennington,—a process which went on to the end of
the year,—so grand an episode was offered to the public
in the trial of the rebel peers, that it took, in the
public eye, the form of the chief spectacle, to which
the Southwark butcheries were only accessories.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>IN WESTMINSTER HALL.</i></div>

<p>When the day for the arraignment of the ‘rebel
lords’ was fixed for July 28th, there was a general movement
of ‘the Quality.’ All who belonged to it rushed
to the country to get a preparatory breath of fresh air.
Nobody, who was at all Somebody, or related thereto,
was expected to remain there for the season. ‘You
will be in town to be sure, for the eight and twentieth,’
wrote Walpole to George Montague (July 3rd).
‘London will be as full as at a Coronation. The whole
form is settled for the trials, and they are actually
building scaffolds (for spectators) in Westminster Hall.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>PREPARATIONS FOR THE NEW TRIALS.</i></div>

<p>The general public watched all the preliminaries of
the trials of the lords with much interest. On the
first Tuesday in July, late at night, the workmen began
to enclose nearly two-thirds of Westminster Hall, ‘to
build a scaffold for the trial of the lords now in the
Tower.’ The mob watched its progress eagerly. By the
next day, as we read in the papers, ‘the platform of the
same scaffolding was laid, being even with the uppermost
step of that leading to the Courts of Chancery and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
King’s Bench.’ All the colours that hung there since
1704, the trophies of Marlborough’s victories, were
taken down, and all the canopies were removed from
the shops or stations, in the hall, in order to make way
for the galleries and scaffolding, which, it was said,
would be kept up for some years, in case of future trials
of Jacobites of lordly degree! All the following Sunday
night, fifty workmen were plying saw, nail, and hammer;
but the gates were shut to keep out a mob which,
by pressure, noise, and drinking, impeded the work in
hand. A favoured many, however, gazed at the royal
box, for the Prince and Princess of Wales, on the right
of the throne, and one on the left, for the Duke of
Cumberland and his friends. Boxes were also erected
for the foreign ministers next to the duke’s. No member
of the royal family had the bad taste to be present,
but the Duke of Cumberland took the oaths which
would enable him to sit, as a peer, in Judgment on the
lords whom he had captured. Happily, he thought
better of it, or he was better advised, and he was becomingly
absent from Westminster Hall, both as judge
and as spectator.</p>

<p>At this juncture, when the feeling in London
against the late Jacobite army was intensified by the
accounts of the reckless and cruel acts which marked
both the advance to Derby and the retreat, every
Scotchman, and especially every Highlander, was
looked upon as a horrible savage; but the Londoners
got good counsel from the old seat of war itself. A
letter from Fort Augustus, dated July 8th, appeared in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
most of the London papers, and it was well calculated
to moderate the superabundant wrath of the metropolis.
‘We see,’ says the writer, ‘a good many letters
here from London, that treat these people with the
opprobrious name of savages, which is a term which
I think they don’t deserve, for, excepting what relates
to the rebellion, I can see nothing in their behaviour
worse than other people, and, I am sorry to say, in
many respects better, bringing rank to rank, and I
only wish some fair measure was pursued, the better
to understand their morals and dispositions by a
friendly intercourse, which, I hope, when the rebellion
is over, will be worth thinking on.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE LORD HIGH STEWARD.</i></div>

<p>On Monday, July 28th, the Lord High Steward set
out in great pomp from his house in Great Ormond
Street to open the proceedings in Westminster Hall.
There were in the procession ’6 led coaches and six,’
and a stupendous state carriage, of which much had
been previously said in the papers. The carriage was
not so remarkable as the attendants upon it. Ten
footmen, bareheaded, were clustered upon the platform
which served for footboard in the rear. When
the spectators had done admiring them, they turned
to the vehicle itself, and rather contemptuously remarked
that it was nothing more than the old faded
state carriage of the mad Duchess of Buckingham, who
used to go to Court in it, as a sprig of royalty, she
being an illegitimate daughter of James <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> However,
there was mock splendour enough to satisfy reasonable
spectators. The great Earl of Hardwicke, Lord High<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
Steward, moved, according to the arrangements of the
Master of the Ceremonies, with six maces before him as
well as ten bareheaded footmen behind him; and less
ceremony would not have suited the circumstance that
was to begin at the bar, in the House of Lords, and
end at the block, on Tower Hill.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE SPECTATORS’ GALLERY.</i></div>

<p>Lord Orford’s gallery, on the south side of the
hall, was filled by his friends. While it was building,
a marriage took place which was thus announced in
the papers. ‘On Wednesday, July the 23rd, Walford,
Esq., clerk of certificates at the custom house, was
married to Miss Rachel Norsa, daughter of Mr. Norsa,
steward to the Earl of Orford, a beautiful young lady
with a very considerable fortune’.... We learn
from Horace Walpole that among the spectators was
‘the Old Jew tavern-keeper, Norsa, now retired from
business.’ He had sanctioned (for money) an arrangement
whereby his daughter, a singer of some eminence,
was to live with Lord Walpole, my lord signing a contract
to marry Miss Norsa when his wife happened to
die—but she happened to survive him. The Jew and
Horace Walpole were in the extensive gallery, which
the latter’s brother, Lord Orford, had at his disposal
as auditor of the exchequer. Horace, not disdaining
to speak to this rascal, Norsa, remarked: ‘I really
feel for the prisoners!’ Old Sparker, as Walpole calls
him, replied, ‘Feel for them! Pray, if they had succeeded,
what would have become of all us?’</p>

<p>They who could not get tickets for the official
galleries thought that there might as well have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
no rebellion! The grand jury of Surrey having found
true bills, the curious order was issued that, on the
above Monday, July 28th, Lord Kilmarnock should be
tried in Westminster Hall at 9 o’clock, Lord Cromartie
at 10, and Lord Balmerino at 11. The three lords
were brought to the hall in three separate carriages,
heavily escorted. It was at starting that the little
difficulty occurred as to which carriage should convey
the official and significant axe; difficulty which Balmerino
terminated by exclaiming, ‘Come, come! put
it in here with me.’ He needed not to have been in
a hurry, for the Lord High Steward kept everybody
waiting, and eleven had struck when the three lords
were brought into the hall together, and then Lord
Hardwick addressed them prosily, yet sharply, on their
alleged wickedness, and he did not particularly interest
them by remarking that their lordships were the first
of their rank who had been brought to trial upon
<em>indictments</em> for high treason, since the passing of the
Act of William <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>KILMARNOCK AND CROMARTIE.</i></div>

<p>On being arraigned, the tall, slender, and dignified
Kilmarnock, and Cromartie, without dignity, or self-possession,
disappointed half the audience by pleading
‘Guilty.’ They were at once removed, Cromartie
almost swooning. Balmerino was left standing, with
the gentleman-gaoler at his side, holding the ominous
axe, with its edge turned away from the prisoner. The
latter conversed with the axe-bearer as unconcernedly
as if both were mere spectators; while talking, he
played with his fingers on the axe, and when a bystander
listened to what Balmerino was saying, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
stout old lord himself turned the blade of the axe in
such a way as to partly hide his face, and to enable
him the better to speak with the gentleman-gaoler without
being heard.
<span class="sni"><i>BALMERINO.</i></span>
Balmerino, on being asked to
plead, fenced rather than fought for his life. He
was not, he said, what the indictment styled him,
‘Arthur, Lord Balmerino, of the city of Carlisle.’ He
could prove, he said, that he was never within twelve
miles of it. On this and other trifling objections
being over-ruled, he bluntly pleaded, <em>Not Guilty</em>, and
the clerk of arraigns as bluntly called out, ‘Culprit,
how will you be tried?’ and Balmerino, looking at
the clerk with some disgust for assuming his guilt,
muttered the formula, ‘by God and my peers’; whereupon
Sir Richard Lloyd opened the case against him.
In a few words to the purpose he accused Balmerino
with waging war against the king, and with slaughtering
the king’s subjects. Sir Richard was followed by
careful Serjeant Skinner, who spoke of Balmerino as
‘this unfortunate peer,’ adding: ‘I will not bring
a railing accusation against this unhappy lord,’ but
he marred this fair precedent by a fierce denunciation
of the traitor whose treason merited death, and whose
condemnation would cover his posterity with infamy.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE PROSECUTION.</i></div>

<p>The serjeant committed a few plagiarisms from
various loyal sermons, such as,—that rebellion was as
wicked as witchcraft, and as absurd as transubstantiation;
and that, had it succeeded, it would have
reduced England to the degraded position of being
a mere province of France. Then, having traced the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
progress of the ‘rebels’ from the landing of the Pretender,
in June 1745, to the battle of Preston Pans,
the serjeant heaved a sigh, and added: ‘I wish we
could forget the miscarriages of that day!’ Having
noted at what period Kilmarnock and Cromartie had
joined the Pretender’s army, and added some forcible
comments on the alleged murdering of the king’s
wounded soldiers on the field at Clifton, the serjeant
alluded to Balmerino having held a commission in
the king’s service, and deserting that service to side
with traitors, whereby ‘he heightened every feature of
the deformity of treason.’ Having sketched the career
of Balmerino from his first entry into Carlisle till his
capture near Culloden, the serjeant gave place to the
Attorney-General, who began by sympathetically remarking
that it was ‘disagreeable to try a noble
person, one of their lordships’ high order,’ and then
Mr. Attorney did what he could to condemn him by
insisting that failing to prove a single event in the
indictment could not invalidate it. On the contrary,
if but one alleged criminal act was proved, a verdict of
<em>Guilty</em> must follow.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>BALMERINO AND MURRAY.</i></div>

<p>Balmerino protested against such interpretation of
the law. But, being asked if he would have counsel
assigned to him to argue the question, he curtly
replied: ‘I don’t want any.’ Only four witnesses were
called. They made brief and simple statements, and
not a question was put to them by way of cross-examination.
William M‘Ghee swore to Balmerino’s
active offices in the rebel army. The accused peer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
only remarked that M‘Ghee confused his dates. ‘I
can’t tell the time myself,’ said Balmerino, ‘unless I
was at home to look at my notes.’ He declined, however,
to ask M‘Ghee any questions. Next, Hugh
Douglas gave similar evidence, with the additional circumstance
that, at Falkirk, where the cavalry were not
engaged, he was with them, and saw Balmerino, Kilmarnock,
and Lord Pitsligo, with the reserve of horse.
One James Patterson corroborated this testimony, and
Balmerino asked him what he was. ‘I am a gentleman’s
servant,’ was the reply. ‘What regiment?’
rejoined Balmerino. Patterson intimated that he was
a soldier, servant to a gentleman in the first troop of
Horse Guards. ‘Horse Guards!’ cried the Lord High
Steward, ‘whose Horse Guards?’ ‘The Pretender’s,’
answered the ‘approver.’ One Roger Macdonald
deposed to similar purpose, and closed the case for the
Crown. Balmerino had ‘nothing to say,’ except that
all the acts laid in the indictment had not been made
out. Long pleadings ensued, the end of which was
unfavourable to the prisoner. ‘My solicitor, Mr. Ross,’
he said, ‘thought as the king’s counsel thinks, but
I thought Mr. Ross was wrong. I was mistaken. I
heartily beg your lordships’ pardon for taking up so
much of your present time.’ It was at this juncture
that the Solicitor-General (brother of the Pretender’s
secretary) officiously and insolently went up to Balmerino
and asked how he dared to give the lords so much
trouble, when his solicitor had told him his plea could
be of no use to him. ‘Who is this person?’ asked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
Balmerino, and being told it was Mr. Murray, ‘Oh!’
exclaimed Balmerino, ‘Mr. Murray! I am glad to see
you. I have been with several of your relations: the
good lady, your mother, was of great use to us at Perth!’
When the votes were about to be taken, Lord Foley
withdrew, ‘as too well a wisher,’ says Walpole. Lord
Moray and Lord Stair also withdrew, being kinsmen of
Balmerino; and Lord Stamford ‘would not answer to
the name of <em>Henry</em>, having been christened Harry.
<span class="sni">‘<i>GUILTY, UPON MY HONOUR!</i>’</span>
All
the remaining peers put their hands to their breasts
and said, ‘Guilty, upon my honour,’ except Lord
Windus, who remarked, ‘I am sorry I must say,
“Guilty, upon my honour.”’ When Lord Townshend
uttered the usual formula, his wife, with her well-known
audacity, applied it to himself, and said, ‘Yes, I knew
he was guilty, but I never thought he would own it
upon his honour!’ The joking and the solemnity being
over, the gentleman-gaoler turned the edge of his axe
towards the traitor, and Balmerino bowed to his judges
and was ushered out of the hall. On going out he
remarked: ‘They call me a Jacobite. I am no
more a Jacobite than any that tried me; but if the
Great Mogul had set up his standard, I should have
followed it, for I could not starve!’ and he good-naturedly
remarked, that if he had pleaded <em>Not Guilty</em>,
it was chiefly that the ladies might not be disappointed
of their show.</p>

<p>Walpole spoke of Balmerino as the most natural,
brave old fellow he had ever seen, his intrepidity
amounting to indifference. While the lords were in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
consultation in their own house, Balmerino shook
hands and talked with the witnesses who had sworn
against him. Among the spectators was a little boy
who could see nothing. Balmerino alone was unselfish
enough to think of him. ‘He made room for the
child,’ says Walpole, ‘and placed him near himself.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>KILMARNOCK’S APOLOGY.</i></div>

<p>On Wednesday, July 30th, the three Jacobite lords,
Kilmarnock, Cromartie, and Balmerino, were brought
from the Tower to Westminster Hall, to receive judgment.
On being asked what they had to say why
sentence should not be passed upon them, Kilmarnock
was the first to speak. Walpole says that, ‘with a
very fine voice he read a very fine speech.’ It was
a very curious speech. Lord Kilmarnock stated that
his father had been a loyal officer of the late King
George in 1715, and that he had since followed his
father’s example, practising and inculcating loyalty on
his estate, till he was unhappily led away. (It was
said that his wife’s rich aunt, the old Countess of
Errol, had forced him into joining Charles Edward,
under the threat that she would leave all her money
elsewhere if he refused. The old lady did, ultimately,
leave her property to Kilmarnock’s widow.) Lord
Kilmarnock passed over the fact that he had led away
his second son into rebellion; but he made a merit of
another fact, that his eldest son, Lord Boyd, was in
the Duke of Cumberland’s army at Culloden, fighting
there, as Walpole remarks, for the liberties of his
country, ‘where his unhappy father was in arms to
destroy them!’ He could have escaped, Lord Kilmarnock<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
said, when he resolved to surrender. He trusted
to King George’s mercy, and he expressed great indignation
that the King of France (through his ambassador)
had been impudent enough to interfere in the
affairs of this kingdom, by interceding in his behalf.
On this point, Walpole remarks, ‘he very artfully
mentioned Von Hoey’s letter, and said how much he
should scorn to owe his life to such intercession!’
Lord Kilmarnock also referred to his tenderness
towards the English prisoners, but, according to
Walpole, it was stated,—that the Duke of Cumberland
had spoken aloud, at a levee, to the effect that
Kilmarnock was guilty of an atrocious proposal to
murder his English prisoners, and that the statement
hardened the king’s heart, who was otherwise disposed
to be merciful. If it had been true, Kilmarnock could
hardly have had the audacity to insist on his kindness
towards the English prisoners, as one ground for mercy
being extended towards him. When Lord Kilmarnock
had read, with dignity and effect, his apology for his
rebellion, Lord Leicester, remembering that the
Ministry had lately given the paymastership of the
army to Pitt, out of fear of his abusive eloquence, went
up to the Duke of Newcastle, and said, ‘I never heard
so great an orator as Lord Kilmarnock. If I was your
grace, I would pardon him and make him paymaster!’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CROMARTIE’S PLEA.</i></div>

<p>Lord Cromartie’s reply could only be heard by
those who sat near him, as he read it with a low and
tremulous voice. They who heard it are said to have
preferred it to Kilmarnock’s address—an opinion in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
which they who now read both will not concur.
Cromartie expressed sorrow at having drawn his
eldest son (who was captured with him) into the
rebellion, and while he hoped for mercy, professed to
be resigned to God’s will, if mercy were denied him;
but the substance of his reply was that he had never
thought of rebelling till there was a rebellion! Walpole
has put on record that if Lord Cromartie had
pleaded ‘<em>Not Guilty</em>,’ there was ready to be produced
against him a paper, signed with his own hand, for
putting the English prisoners to death. The best proof
that the statement is unfounded is the fact that Cromartie
was ultimately pardoned.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>BALMERINO’S DEFENCE.</i></div>

<p>Last came bold Balmerino. He had little to say,
but it was to the purpose. Before the three lords left
the Tower, that morning, a good friend had sent them
a suggestion, in the form of a plea which, if successfully
made, would not only save the lives of the lords, but
stop the further execution of the Jacobites at Kennington.
The plea was,—that as the Act for regulating
the trials of these lords did not take place till after
their crime was committed, judgment ought not to
be pronounced. The plea had been handed to the
Lieutenant of the Tower, who had made it over to
the Governor, the Earl of Cornwallis, by whom it was
laid before the Lords sitting in Westminster Hall, who
‘tenderly and rightly,’ says Walpole, sent it to the
Jacobite peers awaiting judgment. Balmerino alone
made use of it, and he demanded counsel to assist him
in establishing it. ‘The High Steward,’ almost in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
passion, told him that when he had been offered
counsel he did not accept it! After some discussion,
Messrs. Forester and Wilbraham were named as counsel,
and as they needed time to consider the question, the
Court adjourned to Friday, August 1st, on which day
Balmerino’s counsel confessed that the plea was invalid,
and simply apologised for having wasted their lordships’
time, and Lord Hardwicke, after a tedious speech, pronounced
sentence. The worst point in the Lord High
Steward’s speech was in a taunting expression of surprise
at the two earls, who, with so much loyal feeling
as they pretended to possess, had gone into rebellion.
‘Your lordships,’ he remarked, ‘have left that a blank
in your apologies,’ a course, he added, which might be
safely left to the construction of others.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>BALMERINO’S CONDUCT.</i></div>

<p>In the room to which the condemned lords were
conducted after sentence, refreshment was served to
them, previous to their removal to the Tower. When
this had nearly come to an end, Balmerino, ever self-possessed,
proposed that they ‘might have t’other bottle,’
for, said he, alluding to their being now condemned to
separate cells: ‘We shall never meet again till—’ and
here he pointed to his neck. Kilmarnock was more
depressed than Cromartie. Balmerino did not greatly
encourage him by showing how he should lay his
head. He bade him ‘not wince, lest the stroke should
cut his skull or his shoulders, and advised him to bite
his lips.’ In some of the idle half-hours in Court, during
adjournments, Balmerino had played with the tassels
of the axe, and affected to try its edge with his finger.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
His good humour towards it did not last. On this
eventful day, after he had gone into his coach, the
symbolic weapon was rather carelessly flung in, before
the gentleman-gaoler himself took his seat. ‘Take
care!’ cried Balmerino to that official, ‘or you
will break my shins with that damned axe!’ However,
he recovered his good humour by the time he
arrived at Charing Cross, where he stopped the coach
at a fruit stall, that he might buy ‘honeyblobs,’ as the
Scotch call gooseberries. Balmerino had lost his playful
indifference for the gaoler’s weapon. He observed,
with a grim expression, that, as the Lord High Steward
proceeded with his address, the gentleman-gaoler
gradually turned the edge of the axe towards the condemned
peers. On entering the Tower, he thought
no more of himself. ‘I am extremely afraid,’ he said,
‘that Lord Kilmarnock will not behave well!’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>GEORGE SELWYN.</i></div>

<p>George Selwyn, of course, contrived to get a dreary
joke out of the solemnity. He saw plain and meagre
Mrs. Christopher Bethel, her sharp hatchet visage
looking wistfully towards the rebel lords. ‘What a
shame it is,’ said Selwyn, ‘to turn her face to the
prisoners till they are condemned!’ Selwyn, who was
fond of keeping memorials of capital trials and executions
at which he was present, begged Sir William
Saunderson to get him the High Steward’s wand, after
it was broken, when the trials were over. When that
time came, Selwyn had no longer a fancy for the fragments.
Lord Hardwicke, he said, behaved so like an
attorney the first day, and so like a pettifogger the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
second, that he wouldn’t take it to light his fire with.
Walpole gives an illustration of the foreign idea which
found expression in the hall, in which he seems to
have discerned some wit, which might escape the
detection of less acute personages. One foreign
ambassador, addressing another, said, ‘Vraiment, cela
est auguste.’ ‘Oui,’ replied the other, ‘mais cela n’est
pas royal!’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>KILMARNOCK’S PRINCIPLES.</i></div>

<p>There was something about both lords which
diminishes in a certain degree our pity for them. Kilmarnock
and Balmerino were both brave men, each in
his way. The first had a terror of death, but heroically
concealed it. The latter had nothing to conceal, for
he was insensible to fear. But both were void of
lofty principles. Kilmarnock childishly pleaded that
his poverty and not his will drove him to join the
young Prince Charles Edward. This plea was put
forth in his apologetic speech, as well as in private.
‘My lord,’ he said to the Duke of Argyle, who had
expressed his sorrow at seeing Lord Kilmarnock in
such an unhappy condition, ‘for the two kings and
their rights, I cared not a farthing which prevailed;
but I was starving; and by God, if Mahomet had set
up his standard in the Highlands, I had been a good
Mussulman for bread, and stuck close to the party, for
I must eat!’ This poor hungry and noble Scot was
not nice as to the company with whom he dined. So
miserable had been his condition in London that he
was not above taking his dinner with a dealer in pamphlets
sold in the street. This circumstance was told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
to Horace Walpole by an attendant at the Tennis
Court in the Haymarket, where Kilmarnock occasionally
showed himself. ‘He would often have been glad,’
said the professional tennis-player, ‘if <em>I</em> would have
taken him home to dinner!’ The tennis-player was
above stooping to take up with a Scotch lord who could
condescend to dine with a dealer in ballads, broadsides,
and pamphlets. And yet this Scottish peer had an
estate, and a steward upon it, in Scotland. In neither
was there much profit. Lady Kilmarnock once importuned
the steward, for a whole fortnight, for money.
All that she could obtain from him at last, to send to
her lord in London, was three shillings! The steward
seems an unnecessary luxury, and his place a sinecure.
Horace Walpole’s father had settled a pension on
Kilmarnock, which Lord Wilmington, on coming into
power, had taken away. Thenceforth, in London, at
least, he often wanted a dinner.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE PRINCIPLES OF BALMERINO.</i></div>

<p>Balmerino had even less of noble principle than
Kilmarnock. In the Rebellion year of 1715, he was
on the Hanoverian side. The Commander-in-Chief,
the Duke of Argyle, was warned not to trust him;
but the duke relied on him, and Balmerino did his
duty under the duke at Sheriff-Muir. When that
rather indecisive victory had been ‘snatched’ on the
Whig side, Balmerino went off with his troops to the
Pretender, ‘protesting,’ as Walpole says, ‘that he had
never feared death but that day, as he had been
fighting against his conscience.’ He was treated very
leniently by the Government in London. They pardoned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
<div class="sidenote"><i>LENIENCY OF THE GOVERNMENT.</i></div>

<p>a crime which, according to military men, made
him infamous for ever. The pardon lost some of its
grace from the fact that it was granted simply to
engage the vote of Balmerino’s brother at the election
of Scotch Peers! The deserter at Sheriff-Muir took
up arms against the side that had pardoned his desertion.
Like Lord Kilmarnock, he pleaded the
pressure of poverty.</p>

<span class="smcap">etween</span> condemnation and execution,
Drury Lane, as if London had not had
enough of trials and judgments, got up
a showy spectacle, in one act, partly
obtained from Shakespeare’s ‘Henry <abbr title="Five">V.</abbr>,’ called ‘The
Conspiracy Discovered, or French Policy Defeated,’
with ‘a representation of the Trial of the Lords for
High Treason, in the reign of Henry <abbr title="Five">V.</abbr>’ This was
first acted on the 5th of August. But the populace
knew where to find a ‘spectacle, gratis.’</p>

<p>Gazing at the heads above Temple Bar became
a pastime. Pickpockets circulated among the well-dressed
crowd, reaping rich harvest; but, when detected,
they were dragged down to the adjacent river,
and mercilessly ‘ducked,’ which was barely short of
being drowned. A head, called ‘Layer’s,’ had been there
for nearly a quarter of a century. An amiable creature,
in a letter to a newspaper, thus refers to it, in connection
with those recently spiked there:—‘Thursday,
August 7.—Councillor Layer’s head on Temple Bar
appears to be making a reverend Bow to the heads of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
Towneley and Fletcher, supposing they are come to
relieve him after his long Look-out, but as he is under
a mistake, I think it would be proper to put him to
Rights again, which may be done by your means.—<cite>An
Abhorrer of Rebellion.</cite>’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE DUKE AT VAUXHALL.</i></div>

<p>About this time Walpole offers, with questionable
alacrity, evidence against the character of the
Duke of Cumberland. The duke had fixed an evening
for giving a ball at Vauxhall, in honour of a not
too reputable Peggy Banks. The evening proved to
be that of the day on which the lords were condemned
to death, the 1st of August. The duke immediately
postponed the ball, but Walpole says he was ‘<em>persuaded</em>
to defer it, as it would have looked like an insult to
the prisoners.’ After all, the unseemly festivity was
only deferred from the 1st of August to the 4th; and
Walpole was one of the company. He saw the
royalties embark at Whitehall Stairs, heard the National
Anthem played and sung on board state city-barges;
and saw the duke nearly suffocated by the crowds
that greeted him on his landing at Vauxhall. He was
got safely ashore, not being helped by the awkward
officiousness of Lord Cathcart who, a few evenings
previously, at the same place, stepping on the side of
the boat to lend his arm to the duke, upset it; and
the conqueror at Culloden and my lord were soused
into the Thames up to their chins.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>OPINION IN THE CITY.</i></div>

<p>In another letter Walpole declares that the king
was inclined to be merciful to the condemned Jacobites,
‘but the Duke, who has not so much of Cæsar after a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
victory as in gaining it, is for the utmost severity.’
Walpole adds the familiar incident: ‘It was lately proposed
in the city to present him with the freedom of
some company;’ one of the aldermen said aloud: ‘Then
let it be of <em>the Butchers</em>!’ If this alderman ever said
so, he represented the minority among citizens. ‘Popularity,’
writes Walpole (August 12th, 1746), ‘has
changed sides since the year ’15, for <em>now</em>, the city and
the generality are very angry that so many rebels have
been pardoned. Some of those taken at Carlisle dispersed
papers at their execution, saying they forgave
all men but three, the Elector of Hanover, the <em>pretended</em>
Duke of Cumberland, and the Duke of Richmond, who
signed the capitulation of Carlisle.’ This bravado in
the North was not calculated to inspire mercy in the
members of the administration (who were the real
arbiters of doom) in London.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>IN THE TOWER.</i></div>

<p>People of fashion went to the Tower to see the
prisoners as persons of lower ‘quality’ went there to see
the lions. Within the Tower, the spectator was lucky
who, like Walpole, in August, ‘saw Murray, Lord
Derwentwater (Charles Radcliffe), Lord Traquair, Lord
Cromartie and his son, and the Lord Provost, at their
respective windows.’ The two lords already condemned
to death were in dismal towers; and one of
Lord Balmerino’s windows was stopped up, ‘because
he talked to the populace, and now he has only one
which looks directly upon all the scaffolding.’ Lady
Townshend, who had fallen in love with Lord Kilmarnock,
at the first sight of ‘his falling shoulders,’ when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
he appeared to plead at the bar of the Lords, was to
be seen under his window in the Tower. ‘She sends
messages to him, has got his dog and his snuff-box, has
taken lodgings out of town for to-morrow and Monday
night; and then goes to Greenwich; foreswears conversing
with the bloody English, and has taken a
French master. She insisted on Lord Hervey’s promising
her he would not sleep a whole night for Lord
Kilmarnock! And, in return, says she, “Never trust
me more if I am not as yellow as a jonquil for him!”
She said gravely the other day, “Since I saw my Lord
Kilmarnock, I really think no more of Sir Harry
Nisbett than if there was no such man in the world.”
But of all her flights, yesterday was the strongest.
George Selwyn dined with her, and not thinking her
affliction so serious as she pretends, talked rather
jokingly of the executions. She burst into a flood of
tears and rage, told him she now believed all his father
and mother had said of him; and with a thousand
other reproaches, flung upstairs. George coolly took
Mrs. Dorcas, her woman, and made her sit down to
finish the bottle. “And pray, Sir,” said Dorcas, “do
you think my mistress will be prevailed upon to let me
go see the execution? I have a friend that has promised
to take care of me, and I can lie in the Tower
the night before.”—My lady has quarrelled with Sir
Charles Windham, for calling the two lords, malefactors.
The idea seems to be general, for ’tis said, Lord Cromartie
is to be transported, which diverts me for the
dignity of the peerage. The Ministry really gave it as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
a reason against their casting lots for pardon, that it was
below their dignity.’ Walpole, who has thus pictured
one part of London, in 1746, says, in a subsequent
letter,—‘My Lady Townshend, who fell in love with
Lord Kilmarnock, at his trial, will go nowhere to
dinner, for fear of meeting with a rebel-pie. She says,
everybody is so bloody-minded that they eat rebels.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>LORD CROMARTIE.</i></div>

<p>The Earl of Cromartie, the smallest hero of the
Jacobite group, was among the most fortunate. He
owed his comparative good luck to the energy of his
countess who, having driven him into rebellion, moved
heaven and earth to save him from the consequences.
One Sunday, she obtained admission to St. James’s, and
presented a petition to the king, for her husband’s
pardon. The sovereign was civil, but he would not at
all give her any hope. He passed on, and Lady Cromartie
swooned away. On the following Wednesday,
she presented herself at Leicester House, to procure
the good offices of the Princess of Wales, accompanied
by her four children. The princess, seeing the force
and tendency of this argument, ‘made no other answer,’
says Gray, in a letter to Wharton, ‘than by
bringing in her own children, and placing them by
her; which, if true, is one of the prettiest things I ever
heard.’ Lady Cromartie and her daughter, who was as
actively engaged as her mother, prevailed in the end.
Her lord was pardoned; and Walpole made this comment
thereupon: ‘If wives and children become an
argument for saving rebels, there will cease to be a
reason against their going into rebellion.’ Walpole’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
remarks are only the ebullition of a little ill-temper.
Writing to Mann, in August, 1746, he says, ‘The Prince
of Wales, whose intercession saved Lord Cromartie, says
he did it in return for old Sir William Gordon (Lady
Cromartie’s father), coming down out of his death-bed,
to vote against my father in the Chippenham election.
If His Royal Highness,’ adds Walpole, ‘had not
countenanced inveteracy, like that of Sir Gordon, he
would have no occasion to exert his gratitude now, in
favour of rebels.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>LORD KILMARNOCK.</i></div>

<p>The doomed peers bore themselves like men, and
awaited fate with a patience which the unpleasantly
circumstantial old Governor Williamson could not disturb
for more than a moment. On the Saturday before
the fatal Monday, he told Lord Kilmarnock every
detail of the ceremony, in which he and Balmerino were
to bear such important parts. The summoning, the
procession, the scaffold in sables, the whole programme
was minutely dwelt upon, as if the governor took a
sensual delight in torturing his captive. There was
something grim in the intimation that my lord must
not prolong his prayers beyond one o’clock, as the
warrant expired at that hour; and, of course, he could
not lose his head, that day, if he was unreasonably long
in his orisons. There was not much, moreover, of comforting
in the assurance that the block, which had been
raised to the height of two feet, to make it comfortable
for Lord Kenmure, had been so steadied, that Lord
Kilmarnock need not fear any unpleasantness from its
shaking. They talked of the heads and the bodies as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
if they belonged to historical personages. ‘The executioner,’
said the governor, ‘is a good sort of man.’ Kilmarnock
thought his moral character might make him
weak of purpose and performance. My lord hoped
his head would not be allowed to roll about the scaffold.
The governor satisfied him on that point; but, he added,
‘it will be held up and proclaimed as the head of a
traitor.’ ‘It is a thing of no significance,’ said the
earl, ‘and does not affect me at all.’—The governor
then visited Lord Balmerino, whose wife, ‘my Peggy,’
was with him. At an allusion to the fatal day, the poor
lady swooned. ‘Damn you!’ said the old lord, ‘you’ve
made my lady faint away.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ON TOWER HILL.</i></div>

<p>The details of the last scene on Tower Hill are
better known than those of any similar circumstances.
It was nobly said by Balmerino, when he met Kilmarnock,
on their setting out, ‘My Lord, I greatly regret to
have you with me on <em>this</em> expedition.’ Careful of the
honour of his prince, he questioned Kilmarnock on the
alleged issue of the order to give no quarter to the
English, at Culloden. Lord Kilmarnock believed that
the order was in the hands of the Duke of Cumberland,
signed only by Lord George Murray. ‘Then, let
Murray,’ said Balmerino, ‘and not the Prince, bear the
blame.’ He exhorted Kilmarnock, who preceded him
to the scaffold, ‘not to wince;’ and, when he himself
appeared there, he prayed for King James, requested
that his head might not be exposed, and that he might
be buried in the grave where lay the Marquis of Tullebardine.
These requests were granted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE EXECUTIONS.</i></div>

<p>The sight-seers were disappointed in one respect.
The papers had announced that Lord Balmerino had
bespoken a flannel waistcoat, drawers, and night-gown,
in which he had resolved to make his appearance on
the scaffold. But he came in his old uniform, and had
nothing eccentric about him. The newspapers compared
the two sufferers much to Balmerino’s disadvantage.
‘Lord Kilmarnock’s behaviour,’ says the ‘General
Advertiser,’ ‘was so much the Christian and gentleman
that it drew tears from thousands of spectators.’ Then,
remarking that ‘the executioner was obliged to shift
himself by reason of the quantity of blood that flew
over him,’ the ‘Advertiser’ announces that, ‘Balmerino
died with the utmost resolution and courage, and
seemed not the least concerned; nor even the generality
of spectators for him.’</p>

<p>A sympathising Jacobite lady honoured Balmerino
with the following <span class="lock">epitaph:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Here lies the man to Scotland ever dear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whose honest heart ne’er felt a guilty fear.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A much more remarkable, and altogether uncomplimentary,
effusion was to be found in verses addressed
‘to the pretended Duke of Cumberland, on the execution
of the Earl of Kilmarnock, who basely sued for
life by owning the usurper’s power, whereby he became
a traitor, and, though apprehended and condemned for
a loyalist, died a <span class="lock">rebel:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">The only rebel thou hast justly slain</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was base Kilmarnock, &amp;c.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span></p>
<p class="unindent">But this censure sprang from the fact of Kilmarnock’s
declaration that Charles Edward had no religious
principle at all, and that he was prompt to profess
membership with every community where a shadow of
advantage was to be derived from the profession.</p>

<p>There remained two other rebels of quality who
were destined to afford another savage holiday to the
metropolis.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CHARLES RADCLIFFE.</i></div>

<p>On the 21st of November, the road from the
Tower to Westminster was crowded, in spite of the
weather, to see Charles Radcliffe ride, under strong
military escort, to his arraignment in the Court of
King’s Bench. He was the pink of courtesy on his
way, but spoilt the effect by his swagger in Court. He
denied that he was the person named in the indictment,
asserted that he was Earl of Derwentwater; and, it is
supposed, he wished to create a suspicion that he might
be his elder brother, Francis. He would not address
the Chief Justice as ‘my Lord,’ since he himself was not
recognised as a peer. He also refused to hold up his
hand, on being arraigned, though the Attorney-General
appealed to him as a gentleman, and assured him there
was nothing compromising in what was a mere formality.
In short, Mr. Radcliffe, according to the news-writers,
behaved very ‘ungentlemanly to Governor
Williamson as also to Mr. Sharpe for addressing a letter
to him as <em>Mr. Radcliffe</em>. He said he despised the
Court and their proceedings, and he behaved in every
respect indecent and even rude and senseless. He
appeared very gay, being dressed in scarlet faced in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
black velvet, and gold buttons, a gold-laced waistcoat,
bag wig, and hat and white feather.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE TRIAL.</i></div>

<p>On the above Friday, his trial was fixed for the
24th, the following Monday. On the Friday evening,
Radcliffe had one more chance of escape, if he had
only had friends at hand to aid him. ‘As the Guards,’
says the ‘Daily Post,’ ‘were conveying him back through
Watling Street to the Tower, the coach broke down at
the end of Bow Lane, and they were obliged to walk
up to Cheapside before they could get another.’ This
last chance was unavailable, and the captive remained
chafed and restless till he was again brought, in gloomy
array, on the long route from the Tower to the presence
of his judges and of a jury whose mission was not to
try him for any participation in the ’45 Rebellion, but
to pronounce if he were the Charles Radcliffe who,
when under sentence of death for high treason, in 1716,
broke prison, and fled the country. Two Northumbrian
witnesses, who had seen him in arms in ’15, and
who had been taken to the Tower to refresh their
memories, swore to his being Charles Radcliffe, by a
scar on his cheek. A third witness, whose name has
never transpired, but who seems to have been ‘planted’
on Radcliffe, swore that the prisoner, when drunk, had
told him he was Charles Radcliffe, and that he had described
the way in which he had escaped from Newgate.
This witness said, he was not himself drunk at the
time; but Radcliffe, who had evidently treated him to
wine in the Tower, flung at him the sarcasm,—that
there were people ready enough to get drunk if other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
people would pay for it. The jury very speedily found
that the prisoner was the traitor who, when under
sentence of death, had escaped to the Continent. This
old sentence must, therefore, now be executed. There
seemed no room for mercy.
<span class="sni"><i>MR. JUSTICE FOSTER.</i></span>
Mr. Justice Foster, however,
made an effort to save the prisoner. The latter
had pleaded that he was not the Charles Radcliffe
named in the indictment. The jury had found that he
was. At this point the prisoner pleaded the king’s
general pardon. The other judges held that the
prisoner must stand or fall by his first plea; it failed
him, and execution, it was said, must follow. ‘Surely,’
remarked the benevolent Foster, ‘the Court will never
<em>in any state of a cause</em> award execution upon a man
who plainly appeareth to be pardoned.’ He thought
that if anyone could show that Mr. Radcliffe was entitled
to the benefit of the Act of Pardon, he should be
heard. The Chief Justice ruled otherwise, and it was
ultimately shown that as the prisoner had broken
prison when under attainder, he came within certain
clauses of exception in the Act—and could therefore
not be benefitted by it.</p>

<p>The papers of the day make an almost incredible
statement, namely, that Radcliffe was informed, if he
himself would <em>swear</em> he was not the person named in
the indictment, he should have time to bring witnesses
to support him; but he remained silent. Still, ‘he
was very bold,’ is the brief journalistic comment on his
hearing. It is quite clear that Charles Radcliffe did
not keep his temper, and he therefore lost some dignity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
on the solemn occasion of his being brought up to
Westminster Hall to have the day of his execution
fixed. He is described, in the Malmesbury correspondence,
as acting with unheard-of insolence, and apparently
wishing to set the whole Government at
defiance. This is the evidence of a contemporary.
Lord Campbell (in the ‘Life of Lord Chancellor Hardwicke’)
says, on the contrary, that the calmness of his
demeanour, added to his constancy to the Stuart cause,
powerfully excited the public sympathy in his favour.
Moreover, Lord Campbell does not think that the
identity of the Charles Radcliffe of ’45 with him of ’15
was satisfactorily established by legal evidence, though
he has no doubt as to the fact.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CONDUCT OF RADCLIFFE.</i></div>

<p>Radcliffe was condemned to die on the 8th of
December. His high pitch (naturally enough, and
with no disparagement to his courage) was lowered
after his sentence; and he stooped to write in a humble
strain to the Duke of Newcastle, for at least a reprieve.
His niece, the dowager Lady Petre, presented the letter
to the duke, and seconded her uncle’s prayer with extreme
earnestness, as might be expected of a daughter
whose father had suffered, thirty years before, the
terrible death from which she wished to save that
father’s brother. The duke was civil and compassionate,
but would make no promise. In fact, it was resolved
that the younger brother of the Earl of Derwentwater
should die, lying as he did under the guilt of
double rebellion. ‘If I am to die,’ said Radcliffe,
splenetically, ‘Lord Morton ought to be executed at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
Paris, on the same day.’ Morton was a gossiping
tourist, who, being in Brittany, made some idle reflections
on the defences of Port L’Orient in a private letter,
which the French postal authorities took the liberty to
open. This brought the writer into some difficulty
in France, but as no harm was meant, Lord Morton
suffered none.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>TO KENNINGTON COMMON.</i></div>

<p>The ever-to-be-amused public were not left without
diversity of grim entertainment between the condemnation
of Radcliffe and the execution of his sentence.
On Friday, November 28th, there was the strangling
(with the other repulsive atrocities), of five political
prisoners, on Kennington Common, in the morning, and
the revival of a play (which had years before been
condemned because of the political opinions of the
author), in the evening. In the morning, two sledges
stood ready for the dragging of eight prisoners from
the New Prison, Southwark, to the gallows, disembowelling
block, and fire, on the Common. This was
not an unfrequent spectacle; and on this occasion, as
on others, there was, without cowardly feeling, a certain
dilatoriness on the part of the patients, who never
knew what five minutes might not bring forth. Sir
John Wedderburn, indeed, went into the foremost
sledge, with calm readiness, and Governor (of Carlisle)
Hamilton stept in beside him. Captain Bradshaw stood
apart, hoping not to be called upon. There was a
little stir at the gate which attracted feverish attention
on the part of the patients.—‘Is there any news for
me?’ asked Bradshaw, nervously. ‘Yes,’ replied a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
frank official, ‘the Sheriff is come and waits for
you!’ Bradshaw had hoped for a reprieve; but hope
quenched, the poor fellow said he was ready. Another
Manchester Captain, Leath, was equally ready but was
not inclined to put himself forward. Captain Wood,
after the halter was loosely hung for him around his
neck, called for wine, which was supplied with alacrity
by the prison drawers. When it was served round,
the captain drank to the health of the rightful king,
James <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> Most lucky audacity was this for Lindsay,
a fellow officer from Manchester, bound for Kennington.
While the wine was being drunk, Lindsay was
‘haltering,’ as the reporters called it. He was nice
about the look of the rope, but just as he was being
courteously invited to get in and be hanged, a reprieve
came for him, which saved his life. Two other doomed
rebels, for whom that day was to be their last, had
been reprieved earlier in the morning, and that was
why the puzzled spectators, on the way or at the place
of sacrifice, were put off with five judicial murders
when they had promised themselves eight.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CIBBER’S ‘REFUSAL.’</i></div>

<p>In the evening, the play which was to tempt the
town was a revival of Cibber’s ‘Refusal, or the Ladies’
Philosophy.’ It had not been acted for a quarter of a
century (1721), when it had failed through the opposition
of the Jacobites, who damned the comedy, by
way of revenge for the satire which Cibber had heaped
on the Nonjurors. <em>Now</em>, the play went triumphantly.
No one dared,—when the hangman was breathless
with over-work, and the headsman was looking to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
edge of his axe, for the ultimate disposal of Jacobites,—to
openly avow himself of a way of thinking which,
put into action, sent men to the block or the gallows.
All that could be done in a hostile spirit was done,
nevertheless. The Jacks accused Cibber of having
stolen his plot from predecessors equally felonious;
but they could not deny that the play was a good play;
and they asserted, in order to annoy the Whig adaptor,
that the <em>Witling</em> of Theophilus Cibber was a finer touch
of art than that of his father in the same part.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>EXECUTION OF RADCLIFFE.</i></div>

<p>On the 8th of December, Charles Radcliffe closed
the bloody tragedies of the year, with his own. He
came from the Tower like a man purified in spirit, prepared
to meet the inevitable with dignity. They who
had denied his right to call himself a peer, allowed him
to die by the method practised with offenders of such
high quality. The only bit of bathos in the scene on
the scaffold was when the poor gentleman knelt by the
side of the block, to pray. Two warders approached
him, who took off his wig, and then covered his head
with a white skull cap. His head was struck off at a
blow, except, say the detail-loving newspapers, ‘a bit
of skin which was cut through in two chops.’ The individual
most to be pitied on that December morning
was Radcliffe’s young son, prisoner in the Tower, who
was still believed by many to be the brother of the
young Chevalier.</p>

<p>There was another prisoner there whose life was in
peril; namely Simon, Lord Lovat. The progress up to
London of Lovat and of the witnesses to be produced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
against him was regularly reported. There was one of
the latter who hardly knew whether he was to be traitor
or witness, Mr. Murray of Boughton. The following
describes how he appeared on his arrival at Newcastle,
and is a sample of similar bulletins. ‘July 17th. On
Thursday Afternoon, arrived here in a Coach under the
Care of Lieutenant Colonel Cockayne, escorted by a
Party of Dragoons, John Murray, Esq., of Boughton, the
Pretenders Secretary, and yesterday Morning he proceeded
to London. He seem’d exceedingly dejected
and looked very pale.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>LOVAT’S PROGRESS.</i></div>

<p>The London papers sketched in similar light touches
the progress of Lovat. In or on the same carriage in
which he sat were other Frasers, his servants or retainers
who, as he knew, were about to testify against him, and
whose company rendered him extremely irritable. The
whole were under cavalry escort, travelling to London,
only by day. On the morning Lovat left his inn at
Northampton, the landlady was not there to bid him
farewell. The old gallant enquired for her. He was
told that she was unavoidably absent. ‘I have kissed,’
said he, ‘every one of my hostesses throughout the
journey; and am sorry to miss my Northampton landlady.
No matter! I will salute her on my way back!’
On Lovat’s arrival at St. Albans, Hogarth left London,
for what purpose is explained in part of the following
advertisement, which appears in the papers under the
date of Thursday, August 28th. ‘This day is published,
price one shilling, a whole length print of Simon Lord
Lovat, drawn from the life and etch’d in Aqua fortis, by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
Mr. Hogarth. To be had at the Golden Head, in
Leicester Fields, and at the Print shops. Where also
may be had a Print of Mr. Garrick in the character of
Richard <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>, in the first scene, price 7<abbr title="shillings"><i>s.</i></abbr> 6<abbr title="pence"><i>d.</i></abbr>’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>HOGARTH’S PORTRAIT OF LOVAT.</i></div>

<p>On the day on which the above advertisement
appeared, the Rev. Mr. Harris enclosed one of the
sketches of Lovat in a letter to Mrs. Harris, written in
Grosvenor Square, in which he says:—‘Pray excuse
my sending you such a very grotesque figure as the enclosed.
It is really an exact resemblance of the person
it was done for—Lord Lovat—as those who are well
acquainted with him assure me; and, as you see, it is
neatly enough etched. Hogarth took the pains to go to
St. Albans, the evening that Lord Lovat came thither
in his way from Scotland to the Tower, on purpose to
get a fair view of his Lordship before he was locked
up; and this he obtained with a greater ease than
could well be expected; for, in sending in his name
and the errand he came about, the old lord, far from
displeased, immediately had him in, gave him a salute
and made him sit down and sup with him, and talked
a good deal very facetiously, so that Hogarth had all
the leisure and opportunity he could possibly wish to
have, to take off his features and countenance. The
portrait you have may be considered as an original.
The old lord is represented in the very attitude he was
in while telling Hogarth and the company some of his
adventures.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ARRIVAL AT THE TOWER.</i></div>

<p>The old roystering Lovelace who kissed his hostesses
on his way up, and talked of saluting them on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
his way back, was so infirm that to descend from his
carriage he leaned heavily on the shoulders of two
stout men, who put their arms round his back to keep
him from falling. As he crossed Tower Hill he came
suddenly on the partly dismantled scaffold on which
the two lords had recently suffered; and he was heard
to mutter something as to his perception of the way it
was intended he should go. But, on being lifted from
the carriage, he said to the lieutenant, ‘If I were
younger and stronger, you would find it difficult to
keep me here.’—‘We have kept much younger men
here,’ was the reply. ‘Yes,’ rejoined Lovat, ‘but they
were inexperienced; they had not broke so many
gaols as I have.’ The first news circulated in London
after Murray, the Chevalier’s ex-secretary, had passed
into the same prison, was that he had given information
where a box of papers, belonging to the Pretender,
was buried, near Inverness. A couple of king’s messengers
riding briskly towards the great North Road
were taken to be those charged with unearthing the
important deposit.</p>

<p>Of the two prisoners,—one was eager to save his
life by giving all the information required of him. The
other, equally eager, pleaded his innocence, his age,
and his debility; but apart from declaring that he was
a loyal subject, and that he willingly had no share in
the rebellion, although his son had, he remained obstinately
mute to all questioning, or he answered the
grave queries with senile banter.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>REBELS AND WITNESSES.</i></div>

<p>Murray yielded at the first pressure. As early as
July, Walpole speaks of him as having made ‘ample<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
confessions, which led to the arrest of the Earl of
Traquair and Dr. Barry; and to the issuing of warrants
for the apprehension of other persons whom
Murray’s information had put in peril. Walpole believed
that the Ministry had little trustworthy knowledge
of the springs and conduct of the rebellion, till
Murray sat down in the Tower and furnished them with
genuine intelligence.</p>

<p>While he and Lord Lovat were travelling slowly by
land to the Tower, traitors were coming up, by sea, to
depose against him, or any other, by whose conviction
they might purchase safety. The ‘General Advertiser’
announced the arrival in London (from a ship in the
river) of six and twenty ‘Scotch rebels,’ who were conducted
to the Plaisterer’s Corner, St. Margaret’s Lane,
Westminster, where they were kept under a strong
military guard. ‘They are brought up,’ says the
above paper, ‘as evidences for the king. Several of them
are young. Some have plaids on; others in waistcoats
and bonnets, and upon the whole make a most despicable
and wretched figure.’ Meanwhile Lovat struggled
hard for the life he affected to despise, and which
he tried to persuade his accusers was not worth the
taking. He kept them at bay, for months, by his
pleas; and he vehemently declared his innocence of
every one of the seven heads of accusation brought
against him,—of every one of which he was certainly
guilty. Towards the close of December, he was arraigned
at the bar of the House of Lords. There is no
better condensation of what took place than that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
furnished by Walpole, on Christmas Day, 1746:—‘Old
Lovat has been brought to the bar of the House of
Lords. He is far from having those abilities for which
he has been so cried up. He saw Mr. Pelham at a
distance, and called to him, and asked him, if it were
worth while to make all this fuss to take off a grey
head fourscore years old. He complained of his estate
being seized and kept from him. Lord Granville took
up this complaint very strongly, and insisted on having
it enquired into. Lord Bath went farther and, as
some people think, intended the duke; but I believe
he only aimed at the Duke of Newcastle.... They
made a rule to order the old creature the profits of his
estate till his conviction. He is to put in his answer
on the 13th of January.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>TILBURY FORT.</i></div>

<p>In the meantime, the papers reported that there
were nearly four hundred Scottish rebels cooped up in
Tilbury Fort. Watermen’s arms were weary with
rowing boats full of Londoners down to the fort, to
visit the wretched captives, or to stare at the fort
which held them in. Most of them were transported
to the Plantations. There was a sanguinary feeling
against all such offenders. The last words in the
‘General Advertiser’ for December 31st, 1746, are
contained in the two concluding lines of a poem, signed
‘Williamite,’ and which are to the following charitable
<span class="lock">effect:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">A righteous God, with awful hands,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In justice, Blood for Blood demands.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At the same time a print was selling which represented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
‘Temple Bar, the City Golgotha,’ with three
heads on the spikes,—allegorical devils, rebel flags,
&amp;c.,—and more ‘blood for blood’ doggrel intimating
that the naughty sons of Britain might there see ‘what
is rebellion’s due.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>FRENCH IDEA.</i></div>

<p>The idea of altogether sacrificing Charles Edward
was as distasteful to his numberless friends in France,
as it was to the English Jacobites. One of the most
singular of the French suggestions for a definite arrangement
was made to this effect, in some of the
French papers, namely:—that George <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> should withdraw
to his electorate of Hanover, taking his eldest son
and heir with him; renouncing the English crown for
himself and successors, of the elder line, for ever;—that
the Chevalier de St. George should remain as he
was;—that the Prince Charles Edward should be made
King of Scotland and Ireland;—and that the Duke of
Cumberland should, as King of England, reign in
London. It was a thoroughly French idea,—making
a partition of the United Kingdom, and establishing the
duke in the metropolis to reign over a powerless fragment
of it,—a Roi de Cocagne! Both political parties
laughed at it in their several houses of entertainment.</p>

<p>The Prince of Wales, himself, was something of a
Jacobite; but he was a Jacobite for no other reason,
probably, than because his brother, the Duke of Cumberland,
had crushed the Jacobite cause. It is due to
the Prince, however, to notice that he once solemnly
expressed his sympathy when the Princess, his wife,
had just mentioned, ‘with some appearance of censure,’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
the conduct of Lady Margaret Macdonald, who harboured
and concealed Prince Charles when, in the
extremity of peril, he threw himself on her protection.
‘And would not you, Madam,’ enquired Prince Frederick,
‘have done the same, in the same circumstances?
I am sure,—I hope in God,—you would.’ Hogg relates
this incident in the introduction to his ‘Jacobite
Relics,’ and it does honour to the prince, himself,—who
used at least to profess fraternal affection, if not
political sympathy, by standing at an open window at
St. James’s overlooking the Park, with his arm round
the Duke of Cumberland’s neck.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A LONDON ELECTOR’S WIT.</i></div>

<p>Frederick, however, was not a jot more acceptable
to the Jacobites, because he was on bad terms with
the king, and that he refrained from paying any other
compliment than the above-named one to the Duke of
Cumberland, on his victory at Culloden. The prince
invariably came off, more or less hurt, whenever he
engaged personally in politics. When his sedan-chair
maker refused to vote for the prince’s friend, Lord
Trentham, a messenger from his royal highness’s
household looked in upon the elector, and bluntly said,
‘I am going to bid another person make his royal
highness a chair!’ ‘With all my heart!’ replied the
chair maker, ‘I don’t care what they make him, so they
don’t make him a throne!’ Again, on that day which
all Tories kept as an anniversary of crime and sorrow,
the 30th of January,—‘the martyrdom of King Charles,’
the prince entered a room where his sister Amelia was
being tended by her waiting woman, Miss Russell, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
was a great grand-daughter of Oliver Cromwell. Frederick
said to this lady, sportively, ‘Shame, Miss Russell,
why have you not been to Church, humbling yourself,
for the sins on this day committed by your ancestors?’
To which she replied, ‘Sir: I am a descendant of the
great Oliver Cromwell. It is humiliation sufficient to be
employed, as I am, in pinning up your sister’s tail!’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>TRIAL OF LOVAT.</i></div>

<p>During the early months of 1747, the Londoners
waited with impatience for the trial of Lord Lovat.
The old rebel had exhausted every means of delay.
The time of trial came at last. On the 9th of March,
Lovat was taken from the Tower to Westminster Hall.
An immense crowd lined the whole way, and the
people were the reverse of sympathetic. One woman
looked into his coach, and said: ‘You ugly old dog,
don’t you think you will have that frightful head cut
off?’ He replied, ‘You ugly old ——, I believe I
shall!’ Lovat was carried through the hall in a sedan-chair,
and to a private room, in men’s arms. Mr.
Thomas Harris, writing of the trial next day, from
Lincoln’s Inn, says:—‘It was the largest and finest
assembly I ever saw: the House of Commons on one
side; ladies of quality on the other, and inferior spectators
without number, at both ends.’—After much
pantomimic ceremony on the part of officials, Lovat,
having been brought in, knelt (as he is described to
have done on each of the nine days of the trial). On
each occasion Lord Hardwicke solemnly said to him,
‘My Lord Lovat, your Lordship may rise.’ On the
opening day, the prosecuting managers of the impeachment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
sent up by the Commons, ‘went at him,’ at
dreary, merciless, length. After them, the prosecuting
counsel opened savagely upon him, especially Murray,
the Solicitor-General, whose chief witness was his own
Jacobite brother, and who was himself suspected of
having drunk the Pretender’s health on his knees.
Lovat lost no opportunity of saving his life.
<span class="sni"><i>SCENE IN WESTMINSTER HALL.</i></span>
He pitifully
alluded to his having to rise by 4 o’clock, in order to be
at Westminster by 9. He spoke of his frequent fainting
fits; he often asked leave to retire, and, in short, he so
exasperated the Lord High Steward as to make that
official grow peevish, and to wrathfully advise Lord
Lovat to keep <em>his</em> temper. When the Attorney-General
called his first witness, Chevis of Murtoun, the lawyer
described him, with solemn facetiousness, as being as
near a neighbour as man could be to Lovat, but as far
apart from him as was possible in thought and action.
Lovat protested against the legal competency of the
witness, he being Lovat’s tenant and vassal. Hours
were spent over this objection, and the old lord
wearied the clerk, whom he called upon to read ancient
Acts of Parliament, from beginning to end. The protest
was disallowed; and the witness having been asked
if he owed Lovat money, and if a verdict of guilty
might help him not to pay it, emphatically declared
that he owed Lovat nothing. He then went into a
long array of evidence, sufficient to have beheaded
Lovat many times over, as a traitor to the reigning
family, and indeed no faithful servant of the family
desiring to reign. The traitor himself laughed when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
this witness quoted a ballad in English, which Lovat
had composed, ‘in <span class="lock">Erse’:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">When young Charley does come over,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There will be blows and blood good store.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">‘When,’ said the witness, ‘I refused a commission
offered me by the Pretender, Lord Lovat told me I was
guilty of High Treason.’ Further, Lovat had drunk
‘Confusion to the White Horse and the whole generation
of them;’ and had cursed both the Reformation
and the Revolution. Lovat retorted by showing that
this not disinterested witness was a loyal man living at
the expense of Government. ‘He is trying to hang an
old man to save himself,’ said Lovat. This was warmly
denied, but Lovat was right in the implication.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>FATHER AND SON.</i></div>

<p>Lovat’s secretary, Fraser, was a dangerous witness.
He proved that, by Lord Lovat’s order, he, the secretary,
wrote to Lord Loudon (in the service of George
<abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>) informing him that he was unable to keep his son
out of the rebellion, and another letter to the Pretender
that, though unable to go himself to help to restore the
Stuarts, he had sent his eldest son to their standard.
It was shown that the son was disgusted at his father’s
double-dealing, and only yielded to him at last (in
joining the army of Charles Edward), on the ground
that he was bound to obey his sire and the chief of the
clan Fraser. Undoubtedly, the attempt to save himself
by the sacrificing of his son, was the blackest spot in
Lovat’s mean, black, and cruel character. According
to Walpole, ‘he told’ Williamson, the Lieutenant of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
the Tower, ‘We will hang my eldest son and then my
second shall marry your niece!’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE FRASERS.</i></div>

<p>Fraser after Fraser gave adverse evidence. Lovat
maintained that they were <em>compelled</em> to speak against
him. One of them confessed, with much simplicity,
that he lived and boarded at a messenger’s house; but
that he had no orders to say what he had said. ‘I am
free: I walk in the Park or about Kensington; I go at
night to take a glass,’—but he allowed that the messenger
went with him. One or two witnesses had very
short memories, or said what they could for their feudal
superior. Another, Walker, spoke to the anger of
Lovat’s son, on being driven into rebellion. ‘The
Master of Lovat took his bonnet and threw it on the
floor. He threw the white cockade on the fire, and
damned the cockade, &amp;c.’ Lord Lovat, on the other
hand, had sworn he would seize the cattle and plaids
of all the Frasers who refused to rise, and would burn
their houses. One of these adverse Frasers, being hard
pressed by Lovat, allowed that he expected to escape
punishment, for his evidence, but that he had not been
promised a pardon. ‘If,’ said he, ‘I give evidence,
in any case it should be the truth; and,’ he added,
with a composure so comic that it might well have disturbed
the august solemnity, ‘if the truth were such as
I should not care to disclose, I would declare positively
I would give no evidence at all.’ Another witness, a
Lieutenant Campbell, in the king’s service, but who
had been a prisoner in the power of the Jacobites, being
questioned as to a conversation he had had with Lovat,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
made the amusingly illogical remark, ‘As I did not
expect to be called as a witness, so I do not remember
what passed on that occasion.’ The lieutenant did,
however, recollect one thing, namely, that Lovat had
said that his son had gone into the rebellion, but that
he himself was a very loyal person. A second officer,
Sir Everard Falconer, secretary to the Duke of Cumberland
(and very recently married to Miss Churchill,
daughter of the old general), stated that he had been
sent by the duke to converse with Lovat, and he repeated
the loyal assertions that the prisoner had made.
‘Will your Lordship put any question to Sir Everard?’
asked the Lord High Steward, of Lovat. ‘I have only,’
replied Lovat, ‘to wish him joy of his young wife.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>MURRAY OF BOUGHTON.</i></div>

<p>The most important witness of all was, of course,
Mr. Murray, of Boughton, late secretary to the young
Chevalier, and, only a day or two before, a prisoner in
the King’s Bench, from which he had been discharged.
In the course of his answers, Murray said he had been
‘directed’ to give a narrative of the springs and progress
of the late rebellion,—when he came to be examined
at the Bar of the High Court of Justice, where
he was then standing. ‘Directed?’ exclaimed the
Earl of Cholmondely, ‘who <em>directed</em> you?’ The Lord
High Steward and the Earl of Chesterfield protested
they had not heard the word ‘directed’ used by the
witness. There was a wish to have the matter cleared
up, and Murray then said, ‘Some days after my examination
in the Tower, by the honourable Committee of the
House of Commons, a gentleman, who, I believe was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
their secretary, came to me to take a further examination;
and to ask me as to any other matter that had
occurred since my last examination. Some days after
that, he told me I should be called here before your
Lordships, upon the trial of my Lord Lovat, and that at
the same time, it would be <em>expected</em> that I should give
an account of the rise and progress of the Rebellion in
general.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>MURRAY’S EVIDENCE.</i></div>

<p>The above shows pretty clearly how the weak
natures of prisoners in the Tower were dealt with, in
order to get evidence by which they would destroy at
once the life of a confederate and their own honour.
Murray did what he was ‘directed’ or ‘expected’ to
do, without passion but with some sense of pain and
shame. The whole rise and course of the insurrection
may be found in his testimony; he was prepared for
the questions, equally so with the answers he gave to
them; and his evidence is of importance for a proper
understanding of the outbreak. Some merit was made
of his ‘voluntary surrender,’ but Lord Talbot, quite in
Lovat’s interest, roughly asked if Murray had really
intended to surrender himself at the time he became a
prisoner to the Royal forces. The poor man truthfully
answered that ‘it was not then my intention particularly
to surrender myself’;—adding, ‘it was not
my intention till I saw the dragoons;’—but that he
had never since attempted to escape.—‘Have you ever
taken the Oaths of Allegiance and Fidelity to the
King?’ asked Lord Talbot. He never had. ‘Did you
ever take such Oaths to anybody else?’
<span class="sni"><i>CROSS EXAMINATION.</i></span>
Murray let drop<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
a murmured ‘No’; and then Sir William Yonge, one
of the Managers for the Commons, came to his help,
with the expression of a hope that the king’s witness
should not be obliged to answer questions that tended
to accuse himself of High Treason. To which Lord
Talbot replied that the gentleman had already confessed
himself guilty of that crime. Lord Talbot then asked
Murray if he was a voluntary evidence. Murray requested
him to explain what he meant by those two
words. ‘Are you here?’ said Talbot, ‘in hopes of a
pardon? And if you had been pardoned, would you
now be here as a witness at all?’ The Attorney-General
came to the rescue. It was an improper
question, he said, resting upon the supposition of a fact
which had not happened. Lord Talbot insisted: he
asked Murray, ‘Do you believe your life depends upon
the conformity of the evidence you shall give on this
trial, with former examinations which you have undergone?’
There was a fight over this matter, but a lull
came in the fray, and then Murray spoke with a certain
dignity, and said: ‘I am upon my oath and obliged to
tell the truth; and I say that possibly and very probably,
had I been in another situation of life, I should
not have appeared before your Lordships as a witness
against the noble Lord at the Bar.’ There was a touch
of mournful sarcasm in Murray’s truthful answer, which
escaped Lord Talbot, for he remarked: ‘I am extremely
well satisfied with the gentleman’s answer; and
it gives me a much better opinion of his evidence than
I had before.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE VERDICT.</i></div>

<p>The conclusion of the protracted affair was that
Lovat was pronounced <em>guilty</em> by the unanimous verdict
of 117 peers. He made no defence by which he could
profit; and when he spoke in arrest of judgment, he
said little to the purpose. There was a sorry sort of
humour in one or two of his remarks. He had suffered
in this trial by two Murrays, he said, by the bitter
evidence of one, and the fatal eloquence of another, by
which he was hurried into eternity. Nevertheless, though
the eloquence had been employed against him, he had
listened to it with pleasure. ‘I had great need of my
friend Murray’s eloquence for half an hour, myself;
<em>then</em>, it would have been altogether agreeable to me!’
In whatever he himself had done, there was, he said,
really no malicious intention. If he had not been ill-used
by the Government in London, there would have
been no rebellion in the Frasers’ country. George <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>
had been his ‘dear master;’ for George <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> he had
the greatest respect. He hoped the Lords would intercede
to procure for him the royal mercy. The Commons
had been severe against him, let them now be
merciful. Nothing of this availed Lovat. The peevish
Lord Hardwicke called him to order; and then, with
a calm satisfaction, pronounced the horrible sentence
which told a traitor how he should die. Lovat put a
good face on this bad matter.—‘God bless you all!’ he
said, ‘I bid you an everlasting farewell.’ And then, with
a grim humour, he remarked:—‘We shall not meet all
in the same place again, I am quite sure of that!’ He
afterwards desired, if he <em>must</em> die, that it should be in
the old style of the Scottish nobility,—by the Maiden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>GENTLEMAN HARRY.</i></div>

<p>While this tragic drama was in progress, there
arose a report in the coffee-houses of a Jacobite plot.
It came in this way. At the March sessions of the Old
Bailey, a young highwayman, named Henry Simms,
was the only offender who was capitally convicted. ‘If
it hadn’t been for me,’ said the handsome highwayman,
‘you would have had a kind of maiden assize; so, you
might as well let me go!’ As the judges differed from
him, he pointed to some dear friends in the body of the
court, and remarked, ‘Here are half a dozen of gentlemen
who deserve hanging quite as much as I do.’
The Bench did not doubt it, but the remark did not
profit Gentleman Harry, himself, as the young women
and aspiring boys on the suburban roads called him.
But Mr. Simms was a man of resources. As he sat
over his punch in Newgate, he bethought himself of a
means of escape. He knew, he said, of a hellish Jacobite
plot to murder the king and upset the Happy Establishment.
Grave ministers went down to Newgate and
listened to information which was directed against
several eminent persons. Harry, however, lacked the
genius of Titus Oates; and besides, the people in power
were not in want of a plot; the information would not
‘hold water.’ The usual countless mob of savages saw
him ‘go off’ at Tyburn; and then eagerly looked forward
to the expected grander display on Tower Hill.
But Lovat and his friends spared no pains to postpone
that display altogether.</p>

<p>The Scots made a national question of it. The
Duke of Argyle especially exerted himself to get the
sentence commuted for one of perpetual imprisonment.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
This was accounted for by Mr. Harris (Malmesbury
Correspondence), in the following manner: ‘The Duke
owes Lord Lovat a good turn for letting the world
know how active his Grace was in serving the Government
in 1715, and for some panegyric which the Duke
is not a little pleased with.’</p>

<p>In the Tower, Lovat mingled seriousness and buffoonery
together. But this was natural to him. There
was no excitement about him, nor affectation. He
naturally talked much about himself; but he had
leisure and self-possession to converse with his
visitors on other topics besides himself. Only two or
three days before his execution he was talking with
two Scottish landed proprietors. The subject was the
Jurisdiction Bill. ‘You ought to be against the Bill,’
said Lovat; ‘the increase of your estates by that Bill
will not give you such an interest at Court as the
power did which you are thereby to be deprived of.’
The interest of his own friends at Court was gone.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE DEATH WARRANT.</i></div>

<p>On April the 2nd, the Sheriffs of London received
the ‘death warrant’ from the Duke of Newcastle for
Lovat’s execution. At the same time, a verbal message
was sent expressing the duke’s expectation that the
decapitated head should be held up, and denounced
as that of a traitor, at the four corners of the scaffold.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>EXECUTION.</i></div>

<p>On the 9th, the hour had come and the old man
was there to meet it. It is due to him to say that he
died like a man, therein exemplifying a remark made
by Sir Dudley Carleton, on a similar occurrence, ‘So
much easier is it for a man to die well than to live<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
well.’ Lovat was very long over his toilet, from
infirm habit, and he complained of the pain and
trouble it gave him to hobble down the steps from
his room, in order to have his head struck off his
shoulders. On the scaffold, he gazed round him and wondered
at the thousands who had assembled to see such
a melancholy sight. He quoted Latin lines, as if they
illustrated a patriotism or virtue which he had never
possessed or practised. He would have touched the
edge of the axe, but the headsman would not consent
till the Sheriffs gave their sanction. With, or apart
from all this, ‘he died,’ says Walpole, ‘without passion,
affectation, buffoonery, or timidity. His behaviour
was natural and intrepid.’ Walpole adds, ‘He professed
himself a Jansenist.’ Other accounts say, ‘a
Papist,’ which is a Jansenist and something more. ‘He
made no speech; but sat down a little while in a chair
on the scaffold, and talked to the people round him.
He said, he was glad to suffer for his country, <i lang="la">dulce
est pro patriâ mori</i>; that he did not know how, but
that he had always loved it, <i lang="la">Nescio quâ natale solum,
&amp;c.</i>; that he had never swerved from his principles, (!)
and that this was the character of his family who had
been gentlemen for 500 years! He lay down quietly,
gave the sign soon, and was despatched at a blow.
I believe it will strike some terror into the Highlands,
when they hear there is any power great enough to
bring so potent a tyrant to the block. A scaffold fell
down and killed several persons; one, a man that had
ridden post from Salisbury the day before to see the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
ceremony; and a woman was taken up dead with a
live child in her arms.’ This scaffold consisted of
several tiers which were occupied by at least a
thousand spectators. It was built out from the Ship,
at the corner of Barking alley. About a dozen people
were killed at the first crash, which also wounded
many who died in hospital. The master-carpenter
who erected it, had so little thought of its instability,
that he established a bar and tap beneath it. He was
joyously serving out liquors to as joyous customers,
when down came the fabric and overwhelmed them
all. The carpenter was among the killed.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>GEORGE SELWYN.</i></div>

<p>The head was not held up nor its late owner
denounced as a traitor. The Duke of Newcastle was
displeased at the omission, but the Sheriffs justified
themselves on the ground that the custom had not
been observed at the execution of Lord Balmerino,
and that the duke had not authorised them to act, in
writing. A sample of the levity of the time is furnished
in the accounts of the crowds that flocked to the trial
as they might have done to some gay spectacle; and
an example of its callousness may be found in what
Walpole calls, ‘an excessive good story of George
Selwyn.’ ‘Some women were scolding him for going
to see the execution, and asked him how he could be
such a barbarian to see the head cut off?’ “Nay,” says
he, “if that be such a crime, I am sure I have made
amends, for I went to see it sewed on again!” When
he was at the undertaker’s, Stephenson’s in the Strand,
as soon as they had stitched him together, and were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
going to put the body into the coffin, George, in my Lord
Chancellor’s voice, said, “My Lord Lovat, your Lordship
may rise.”’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>LOVAT’S BODY.</i></div>

<p>Lovat had expressed a passionate desire to be
buried in his native country, under the shadow of its
hills, his clansmen paying the last duty to their chief,
and the women of the tribe keening their death-song
on the way to the grave. The Duke of Newcastle
consented. The evening before the day appointed for
leaving the Tower, a coachman drove a hearse
about the court of the prison, ‘before my Lord Traquair’s
dungeon,’ says Walpole, ‘which could be no
agreeable sight, it might to Lord Cromartie, who is
<em>above the chair</em>.’ Walpole treats Lord Traquair with
the most scathing contempt, as if he were both coward
and traitor, ready to purchase life at any cost. After
all, Lovat’s body never left the Tower. ‘The Duke of
Newcastle,’ writes Walpole to Conway, 16th April, on
which night London was all sky-rockets and bonfires
for last year’s victory, ‘has burst ten yards of breeches-strings,
about the body, which was to be sent into
Scotland; but it seems it is customary for vast numbers
to rise, to attend the most trivial burial. The
Duke, who is always at least as much frightened at
doing right as at doing wrong, was three days before
he got courage enough to order the burying in the
Tower.’</p>

<p>Lovat’s trial brought about a change in the law.
On the 5th of May, Sir William Yonge, in the House
of Commons, brought in a good-natured Bill, without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
opposition, ‘to allow council to prisoners on impeachment
for treason, as they have on indictments. It
hurt everybody at old Lovat’s trial, all guilty as he
was, to see an old wretch worried by the first lawyers
in England, without any assistance, but his own unpractised
defence. This was a point struggled for in
King William’s reign, as a privilege and dignity inherent
in the Commons—that the accused by them
should have no assistance of council. How reasonable
that men chosen by their fellow-subjects for the
defence of their fellow-subjects should have rights
detrimental to the good of the people whom they are
to protect. Thank God! we are a better-natured age,
and have relinquished this savage principle with a good
grace.’ So wrote Walpole in Arlington Street.</p>

<p>After Lovat’s death, the friends of the Happy
Establishment ceased to have fears for the stability of
the happiness or for that of the establishment. Walpole
declined thenceforth to entertain any idea of Pretender,
young or old, unless either of them got south of Derby.
When Charles Edward ‘could not get to London with
all the advantages which the ministry had smoothed
for him, how could he ever meet more concurring
circumstances?’ Meanwhile, the ‘Duke’s Head,’ as a
sign, had taken place of Admiral Vernon’s in and about
the metropolis, as Vernon’s had of the illustrious
Jacobite’s—the Duke of Ormond.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE WHITE HORSE, PICCADILLY.</i></div>

<p>There was in Piccadilly an inn, whose loyal host,
Williams, had set up the then very loyal sign of ‘The
White Horse’ (of Hanover). While Lovat’s trial was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
proceeding, that Whig Boniface had reason to know
that the Jacobites were not so thoroughly stamped out
as they seemed to be. Williams attended an anniversary
dinner of the Electors of Westminster, who
supported ‘the good old cause.’ He was observed to
be taking notes of the toasts and speeches, and he was
severely beaten and ejected. He laid an information
against this Jacobite gathering, and he described one
of the treasonable practices thus:—‘On the King’s
health being drunk, every man held a glass of water in
his left hand, and waved a glass of wine over it with
the right.’ A Committee of the House of Commons
made so foolish an affair of it as to be unable to draw
up a ‘Report.’ If the enquiry had extended three
years back, Walpole thinks, ‘Lords Sandwich and
Grenville of the Admiralty would have made an
admirable figure as dictators of some of the most
Jacobite toasts that ever were invented. Lord Donerail
... plagued Lyttelton to death with pressing
him to enquire into the healths of the year ’43.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>JACOBITE TOASTS.</i></div>

<p>On the first anniversary of Culloden, the celebration
of the day was as universally joyous as when the
news of the victory first reached town. The papers
speak of a ‘numerous and splendid appearance of
nobility,’ at St. James’s; of foreign ministers and
native gentry, eager to pay their compliments to his
Majesty on this occasion. At night, London was in a
blaze of bonfires and illuminations. At the same time,
in houses where Jacobites met, they drank the very
enigmatical toast, ‘<em>The three W’s</em>,’ and talked of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
private manifesto of the Chevalier to his faithful
supporters, which stated that the late attempt was an
essay, which would be followed in due time by an
expedition made with an irresistible force. But there
were also Jacobites who ‘mourned Fifteen renewed in
Forty-five,’ and whose sentiments were subsequently
expressed by Churchill’s <em>Jockey</em> in the ‘Prophecy of
<span class="lock">Famine’:—</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE EARL OF TRAQUAIR.</i></div>

<p>There was still an untried rebel peer in the Tower,
the Earl of Traquair. He bore the royal name of
Charles Stuart, and had some drops of the Stuart blood
in his veins. Captured in 1746, he had seen the
arrival of Lovat at, and also his departure from, the
Tower. Soon after the latter event, there was some
talk of impeaching the earl; but this was held to be
idle talk when the earl was seen enjoying the liberty
of the Tower—walking in one of the courts with his
friends. Whether he had rendered any service to
Government, to be deserving of this favour and subsequent
immunity, is not known. Walpole, when Lovat’s
trial was going on, said, ‘It is much expected that
Lord Traquair, who is a great coward, will give ample
information of the whole plot.’ However, it is certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
that many Jacobites were pardoned without any such
baseness being exacted from them. Sir Hector Maclean
and half-a-dozen other semi-liberated rebels were to be
seen going about London, with a messenger attending
on them. Other messengers, however, were often
sudden and unwelcome visitors in private houses, in
search for treasonable papers and traitorous persons.
Gentleman Harry’s idea of a plot was said, in loyal
coffee-houses, to be a reality; and the quidnuncs there
were quite sure that money was going into the Highlands
from France, and small bodies of Frenchmen
were also being sent thither, and capable Scottish and
English sergeants were now and then disappearing.
The only ostensible steps taken by the Government
was to make a new army-regulation, namely, that the
3rd (Scottish) regiment of Foot Guards, and all other
regiments, bearing the name Scottish, should henceforward
be called English, and ‘the drums to beat none
but English marches.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>PLOTTING AND PARDONING.</i></div>

<p>Therewith came a doubtful sort of pardoning to
about a thousand rebels cooped up in vessels on the
Thames, or in prisons ashore. They, and some Southwark
prisoners who had been condemned to death,
were compelled to suffer transportation to the American
Plantations. ‘They will be transported for life,’ the
papers tell their readers, ‘let them be of what quality
and condition soever.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ÆNEAS MACDONALD.</i></div>

<p>There was one Jacobite prisoner in Newgate who
was disinclined to live in durance, to take his trial, or
to be hanged after it or transported without it. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
was Æneas or Angus Macdonald, known as the Pretender’s
Banker. He had surrendered soon after
Culloden, and was lodged in Newgate. Seeing the
death-like aspect of things, Macdonald got two friends
to call upon him, one evening. There was nothing
strange in such a visit. Newgate was like a huge
hotel, open at all hours, where turnkeys acted as
footmen who introduced visitors. Young Mr. Ackerman,
the keeper’s son, received Mr. Macdonald’s
friends. As soon as he had opened the wicket, behind
which the prisoner was standing, they knocked Ackerman
down, and as he was attempting to rise, they
flung handfuls of snuff into his face. He succeeded
in getting on his legs, but, when he could open his
eyes, the captive and his friends had disappeared.
Alarm was given; young Ackerman led the pursuit,
and he came up with Macdonald in an adjacent street.
Æneas faced his pursuer as if to quietly surrender,
but as soon as Ackerman came near, he flung a cloud
of snuff into his face. The gaoler struck him down
with his keys and broke his collarbone. When Macdonald
was again within the prison walls, he politely
apologised for the trouble he had given. Mr. Ackerman
quite as politely begged him not to think of it,
‘but, you see, Sir,’ he added, ‘I am bound to take care
it does not happen again,’ and clapping a heavy suit of
irons on the prisoner’s limbs, he stapled and screwed
the banker down to the floor, sending the surgeon to
him to look to his collarbone.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE COUNTESS OF DERWENTWATER.</i></div>

<p>The banker’s trial was put off from time to time,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
between July and December. The public in general
were beginning to doubt its ever coming on at all;
and the autumn seemed dull to people now long used
to excitement, when London suddenly heard that
Charles Radcliffe’s widow, with a son and two
daughters, had arrived in London, and had taken a
mansion in, then highly fashionable, Golden Square.
She was a Countess (of Newburgh), in her own right;
but, of course, the gentry with Jacobite sympathies,
who called on her, recognised her as Countess of
Derwentwater. This arrival in Golden Square may
have had some influence on a demonstration at Westminster
Abbey. For years, on the anniversary of that
rather un-English king and canonized saint, Edward
the Confessor, groups of Roman Catholics were accustomed
to gather round his shrine, kneeling in
prayer. ‘Last Tuesday,’ says the ‘Penny Post,’ ‘being
the anniversary of Edward the Confessor, the tombs
were shut in Westminster Abbey, by order of the Dean
and Chapter, to prevent the great concourse of Roman
Catholics, who always repair there on that day. Notwithstanding
which, most of them were kneeling all
the day at the gates, paying their devotions to that
Saint.’</p>

<p>This incident having passed out of discussion, the
trial of Macdonald was looked for. When it did come
on, in December, at St. Margaret’s, Southwark, it
disappointed the amateurs of executions, and delighted
the Jacobites. The prisoner’s main plea was that he
was French, and was legally at Culloden. The jury<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
found that he was not French, but was a Scotch rebel.
He was sentenced to death; but the whole thing was
a solemn farce, the sentence was not carried out;
and we shall presently see wherefore he was immediately
liberated on condition of leaving the kingdom
for ever, with liberty to live where he pleased, out
of it.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>SERGEANT SMITH.</i></div>

<p>This was on December 10th. All public entertainment
for the death-delighting mob seemed suppressed;
but there was an exulting crowd the next
day, lining the road from the barracks and military
prison, in the Savoy, to the parade, St. James’s Park,
and from the latter place to Hyde Park, where savages
had come ‘in their thousands,’ and assembled round a
gibbet in the centre of the Park. From the Savoy
was brought a stalwart sergeant, in gyves, marching,
without music, and eagerly gazed at as he passed on
his way to the Parade. He was a good soldier, something
of a scholar, knew several languages, and was
utterly averse from serving any other sovereign than King
James or his friend King Louis. Sergeant Smith had
deserted, had been caught, and was now to suffer, not
a soldier’s death by shooting, but the ignominious one
of a felon. On the Parade, he was received by his
own regiment, in the centre of which he was placed,
and so guarded went slowly on to Hyde Park, to a
dead roll of the drums. He was dressed in a scarlet
coat, all else white. In token of his Jacobite allegiance,
he wore, and was allowed to wear, a rosette of tartan
ribbons on his bosom, and similar bunches of ribbons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
on each knee. The sergeant went on with a smile.
His self-possession made the hangman nervous, and
Smith bade his executioner pluck up a spirit and do
his duty. And so he died; what remains of him may
perhaps still lie in the Park, for the Jacobite sergeant
was buried beneath the gibbet. The quality of the
newspaper reporting at this time is illustrated by the
fact that, in some of the journals, Jacobite Smith is
said to have been shot.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE JACOBITE’S JOURNAL.</i></div>

<p>In December 1747, a new paper was started, called
the ‘Jacobite’s Journal.’ It was eminently anti-Jacobite,
and was adorned with a head-piece representing a
shouting Highlander and his wife on a donkey, to
whose tail is tied the shield and arms of France;
and from whose mouth hangs a label ‘Daily Post;’
the animal is led by a monk with one finger significantly
laid to the side of his nose. The journal
joked savagely at the idea of the above-named Sergeant
Smith, being compelled to listen to his own funeral
sermon in the Savoy Chapel, and hoped there was no
flattery in it. As to the gay rosettes of tartan ribbons
which he wore, the journal was disgusted with such a
display on the part of a traitor.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CARTE’S HISTORY OF ENGLAND.</i></div>

<p>There remains to be noticed the appearance this
year of the first volume of the Jacobite Carte’s History
of England. It was received with a universal welcome
which was soon exchanged for wrath on the part of
the Hanoverians. Although Carte was a non-juring
clergyman, had been in ’15 and again in ’22 ‘wanted’
by the Secretary of State, and had been secretary to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
Atterbury, he was permitted to live unmolested in
England, after 1729, at the request, it is said, of Queen
Caroline. Belonging to both Universities, the two
antagonistic parties in politics were disposed to receive
him on friendly terms. His ‘Life of James, Duke of
Ormond,’ published in 1736, was such a well-merited
success, that when Carte subsequently circulated his proposals
for putting forth a general History of England,
the proposal was received with the greatest favour.
All parties recognised his ability. The Tories expected
from him freedom of expression; the Whigs trusted in
his discretion. In the collecting of materials, Carte
was assisted by subscriptions from the two Universities,
the Common Council, and several of the Civic Companies
of London, and from other public bodies.
These subscriptions are said to have amounted to
600<abbr title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr> a year. The sum was honestly laid out. Carte
spared no pains nor expense, at home or abroad, in
collecting materials. We may add that England still
possesses the collections, including much of great
interest, which Carte had not occasion to use. At
length, in 1747, the first volume appeared. Almost
immediately afterwards, the London Corporation and
the City Companies withdrew their subscriptions. All
public support from the Whigs fell away from the
author. The Jacobite author offended the Hanoverians
by unnecessarily thrusting in his Jacobitism. The
offence which shocked the Hanoverian sensibilities was
conveyed in a note which was, to say the least, indiscreet.
Therein, speaking of the power, supposed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
be reserved to kings, of curing ‘the evil,’ Carte betrayed
his own belief in the right divine of the Stuart family,
by ascribing to the Pretender the preternatural cure
of one Lovel, at Avignon, in 1716, ‘by the touch of a
descendant of a long line of kings.’ The consequences
of this indiscretion, which London was the first to
resent, materially crippled Carte’s means of proceeding;
but he lived to see three volumes through the press,
and to leave one more in manuscript, which brought
the history down to the year 1654, and which was
published in 1755, the year after that in which Carte
died. Carte was dying when the loyal feelings of
London were stirred with an emotion which spread
to such Whig readers as were to be found in the
country.
<span class="sni"><i>HUME’S ‘HISTORY.’</i></span>
The feeling was aroused by the publication
of Hume’s ‘History of the Reigns of James the First
and Charles the First,’ the first instalment of the general
History of England which Hume wrote, so to speak,
backwards. Such opposition was shown by the
Hanoverians, to what was looked upon as a defence of
the proscribed family, that Hume was disposed to give
up his assumed office of a writer of English history.
Fortunately, he thought better of it, and completed a
great work which is as unjustly abused as Carte’s is
undeservedly forgotten.</p>

<p>In this year, the first taste of the quality of Johnson’s
political feelings is furnished by Boswell. At
this period, Johnson was a thorough Jacobite.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>JACOBITE JOHNSON.</i></div>

<p>The highest praise which he could give to Dr.
Panting, the Master of Pembroke (Johnson’s College),<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
was to call him ‘a fine Jacobite fellow.’ The worst he
could say of the Gilbert Walmsley, of Lichfield, whom
he loved and honoured, was that ‘he was a Whig,
with all the virulence and malevolence of his party.’
Boswell’s father pelted Johnson with the term which
Johnson applied to Panting, as one of laudation, and
spoke of him contemptuously as ‘that Jacobite fellow.’</p>

<p>The truth is, that if Johnson felt the principle of
allegiance due to the Stuarts, he felt no love for the
system which prevailed where the Stuarts found their
best friends: ‘A Highland Chief, Sir, has no more the
soul of a chief, than an attorney who has twenty houses
in a street, and considers how much he can make by
them.’ Johnson had but scant eulogy for a convert
from Whiggery. To join the Tories was to ‘keep
better company.’ In an honest Whig, the learned
Jacobite had no belief; ‘Pulteney,’ he remarked,
‘was as paltry a fellow as could be. He was a Whig
who pretended to be honest, and you know it is ridiculous
for a Whig to pretend to be honest. He cannot
hold it out.’ It would be difficult to say whether
Cibber or George <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> was the more hateful object to
Johnson. He gibbeted both in the epigram he took care
not to <span class="lock">publish:—</span></p>

</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>JOHNSON’S SYMPATHIES.</i></div>

<p>It was perhaps accidental that during the years
1745-6 Johnson’s literary work seems to have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
almost suspended. ‘That he had a tenderness for that
unfortunate house’ (of Stuart, said Boswell) ‘is well
known, and some may fancifully imagine that a sympathetic
anxiety impeded the exertion of his intellectual
powers, but I am inclined to think that he was, during
this time, sketching the outlines of his great philological
work.’ It is not certain that Johnson was the author
of the following lines, which appeared in the ‘Gentleman’s
Magazine,’ for April 1747, but his fond habit of
repeating them, ‘by heart,’ is some proof of his sympathy
with the Jacobites named therein; and their publication
demonstrates that the Government respected
hostile opinion when it was becomingly expressed.</p>

<p>For the sake of ‘the cause,’ Johnson could tolerate
persons of very indifferent character, always providing
they were not fools. Topham Beauclerk was a handsome
fellow, of good principles, to which his practices
in no wise answered. Boswell calls him lax in both,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
but Johnson said to Beauclerk himself, ‘Thy body is
all vice, and thy mind all virtue.’ And why did Jacobite
Johnson love, nay, become fascinated by this other
Jacobite? Boswell gives the reason: ‘Mr. Beauclerk,
being of the St. Alban’s family, and having in some
particulars a resemblance to Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>, contributed,
in Johnson’s imagination, to throw a lustre upon his
other qualities; and, in a short time, the moral, pious
Johnson, and the gay, dissipated Beauclerk were companions.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>FLORA MACDONALD.</i></div>

<p>The arrival in London of the most interesting of all
the Jacobite prisoners in 1746, and her departure in
1747, are left unrecorded, or dismissed in a line, by the
journalists. Flora Macdonald, on board the ‘Eltham,’
arrived at the Nore, on the 27th of November,
1746. Transferred to the ‘Royal Sovereign,’ Flora
was brought up to the Tower. Soon after, she was
allowed to live in the house, and under the nominal restraint,
of Mr. Dick, the messenger. After her release,
and complete liberation in 1747, without any questioning,
Flora Macdonald is said to have been the favoured
guest of Lady Primrose, in Essex Street, and the <em>lionne</em>
of the season. Tradition says she owed her liberty to
the Prince of Wales, and the romance of history has
recorded a visit paid by the prince to the guest in that
Jacobite house, and has reported all that passed and
every word that was uttered when Flora was thus ‘interviewed.’
Imagination built up the whole of it. The
only known fact is that Flora was captured and was
released. Among other liberated prisoners was Macolm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
Macleod, of Rasay. The two together, Flora having
chosen Macleod for her protector on her journey to
Scotland, started from Essex Street in a post-chaise;
and ‘conjecture,’ which has freely played with this
London incident, suggests that loud cheers were given
by Jacobite sympathisers as the couple drove off.
When they arrived in Scotland, Macleod remarked
joyously to his friends: ‘I went to London to be
hanged, and I came back in a post-chaise with Miss
Flora Macdonald.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>FLORA’S SONS.</i></div>

<p>Flora, it is well known, married Macdonald of
Kingsburgh, settled in America, took the royalist side,
when the Colonies revolted, returned to Skye, and gave
her five sons to the military or naval service of the
Georges! When the latest survivor of the five brothers,
Lieut.-Col. Macdonald, was presented to George <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr>,
the imaginative king fancied himself a Stuart, of unmixed
blood, and said to those around him: ‘This
gentleman is the son of a lady to whom <em>my family</em>
owe a great obligation.’ And such was the debt of the
‘family’ for Flora’s five sons.</p>

<h3>(1748 to 1750.)</h3>
</div>


<div class="sidenote"><i>DEPRECIATION OF THE STUARTS.</i></div>

<p class="drop-img unindent"><span class="drop-img"><img alt="t" src="images/drop_t_a.jpg" width="75"></span>
<span class="smcap">he</span> Government at this time began to be
embarrassed with the surviving Jacobite
prisoners. Many who were destined for
the Plantations, and had made their little
melancholy preparations for going into a life-long
exile and slavery, were set free unconditionally.
Others were variously treated. In January, 1748,
Æneas Macdonald was brought from Southwark gaol to
the Cockpit, where he was examined by the Dukes of
Newcastle, Dorset, and Montague, the Earl of Chesterfield,
and others of the Privy Council. It is not known
what was got from him; but one result of the examination
was that his execution, which had been fixed for
Friday, the 22nd, was deferred ‘for some days.’ The
report was immediately raised in London that the
Earl of Traquair would be tried for his life, and
Macdonald would be admitted king’s evidence against
him. The report was unfounded, for the earl was soon
afterwards liberated on bail. Four dukes—Norfolk,
Gordon, Hamilton, and Queensborough—were his
sureties. Macdonald was also set free. The Government
thought they had captured Lord Elcho at Dover;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
and the prisoner, with three others, was brought to
London, where they proved to be four Jacobite <i lang="fr">valets
de chambre</i>, who were on their way to join their
escaped rebel masters in France. Other small game
continued to be brought to town from time to time,
particularly deserters from the duke’s army, when in
Carlisle, to that of the Chevalier. For such men there
was no mercy. Death, or worse than death, was the
penalty. The journals give an account of six deserters
being whipt in St. James’s Park. ‘One of them refusing
to be tied up to the Halberts, in a very obstreperous
manner, was tied and drawn up to a tree, and
very severely handled for his obstinacy.’</p>

<p>Exultation over the victory at Culloden was still
prevailing. In other respects, it may be asserted that
apprehensions of domestic disturbances had now
pretty well ceased. Walpole felt that if the French
attempted an invasion, it would be for themselves, and
not for the Chevalier. ‘They need not be at the
trouble,’ he wrote in January, ‘of sending us Stuarts;
that ingenious House could not have done the work of
France more effectually than the Pelhams and the
patriots have.’ The London Whigs maintained the
memory of the triumph of Cumberland. For years
they kept the anniversary of the Jacobite overthrow at
Culloden by dining, or drinking, or doing both, together.
Here is a sample of what they thought of the triumph,
taken from the advertisement columns of ‘The General
<span class="lock">Advertiser:’—</span></p>

<p class="blockquot">‘<span class="smcap">Half-Moon Tavern, Cheapside.</span> Saturday next,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
the 16th April, being the anniversary of the Glorious
Battle of Culloden, the Stars will assemble in the Moon,
at six in the evening. Therefore, the choice spirits are
desired to make their appearance and fill up the joy.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE GOVERNMENT AND THE JACOBITES.</i></div>

<p>Within a month, however, the Government were
referring to the Jacobites, as if the rebellion had not
been stamped out at Culloden. The special occasion on
which the Jacobites were ill-spoken of in Parliament
this year was in the House of Lords. The Peers were
discussing the Scottish episcopal question, and the
Highland dress. Lord Hardwicke, the Chancellor, with
other Lords, denounced the Scottish bishops as Nonjurors,
whose <i lang="fr">congé d’élire</i>, if there was one, came from
the Pretender; and whose ‘orders,’ conferred on
others, could only be a farce. Jacobitism had by no
means lost its vitality. In some cases it had been
bribed into a deceitful calm, which might be followed
by a storm at any opportunity. Lord Hardwicke
thought the condemned Jacobites had been too leniently
dealt with, and that they would have had no cause to
complain had the most rigorous penalties been exacted.
In short, his lordship went far to authorise Lord Campbell’s
judgment, that if the Duke of Cumberland was
responsible for the way in which he stamped out
rebellion in Scotland, Lord Hardwicke, at Westminster,
was responsible for the judicial murders committed
on rebels. The following is from the speech, which
aroused some surprise in the House of <span class="lock">Lords:—</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ENLARGEMENT OF PRISONERS.</i></div>

<p>‘Every man who has taken orders from a nonjuring
Bishop in England or Scotland must be supposed to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
disaffected to our present happy establishment. I
think the government ought not to allow them to be
preachers in any congregation whatever.’—After allowing
that there were honest Nonjurors, who, while preserving
their principles, refrained from all hostility
towards the Government, the Lord Chancellor said there
were others, ‘who, notwithstanding being Jacobites in
their hearts, not only take all the oaths we can impose,
but worm themselves into places of trust and confidence
under the present government, and yet join in, or are
ready to join in, any rebellion against it; and with
respect to such men I must say that no regulation we
can make, no punishment we can inflict, can be called
cruel and unjust.’</p>

<p>No doubt one of the Jacobites to whom Lord
Hardwicke alluded was the Jacobite Mr. Pitt, Lord
of Trade, and the pet M.P. of Jacobite Wareham.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>IN THE PARK AND ON THE MALL.</i></div>

<p>For all this, lenity towards the Jacobite prisoners
continued to be practised. The three brothers Kinloch
were liberated from close custody. Sir James Kinloch
and Mr. Stewart were to be confined to an English provincial
town, with liberty of walking to a distance of a
couple of miles. The exact conditions were,—‘that they
should remain in such places, as his Majesty, his heirs,
and successors shall from time to time appoint.’ Then
came pardons, a half-dozen at a time, to various of the
‘Manchester officers’ taken at Carlisle, who had been
lying under sentence of death since 1746. Among
them was Captain Lindsay, who was haltered and in the
sledge, with Governor Hamilton and Sir John Wedderburn,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
when a reprieve arrived for him at the prison-gate.
The two younger brothers Kinloch, with Farquharson
of Monaltries, were banished, but might go
whithersoever they would, except to any part of the
British dominions. The most joyous party of Jacobites
was that of the Earl of Cromartie (or ‘Mr. Mackenzie,’ as
he was called since his attainder) and his family. The
eldest son, Lord Macleod, was freely pardoned. The
earl was permitted to leave the Tower, but he was
bound to reside in the house of a King’s Messenger.
Accordingly, the earl, countess, my lord, the younger
children, and a servant or two, were to be seen alighting
from a hackney-coach at the door of Mr. Lamb’s
house in Pall Mall. Their appearance at the windows
attracted many a gazer, and when Mr. Lamb permitted
them to stroll on the Mall, crowds of sympathisers congratulated
them as they passed. Later, the earl had
so far an extension of liberty as was to be found in a
permission, or order, to reside in some town in the
south of England.</p>

<p>It was probably by accident that, on the Pretender’s
birthday, June 10th, a special free pardon passed the
Great Seal for Mr. John Murray, of Boughton, and
Hugh Fraser, gentleman (king’s witnesses against Lord
Lovat). Murray obtained a pension of 200<abbr title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr> a year.
The pardon cleared them of all treason committed
before 1st May, 1748. On Saturday, the 11th, they
were both at large, and were to be seen, two pale men,
trying to get a complexion in the parks. At the same
time small parties of men left London for Scotland, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
the purpose of fortifying various points of that kingdom,
an invasion of which by the French was vaguely talked
of in all taverns and coffee-houses in London. There
was certainly an undefined fear from the beginning of
the year of something being intended there in the
interest of the Pretender.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE STATUE IN LEICESTER SQUARE.</i></div>

<p>In 1742, the Prince of Wales had promised the mob
greeting him on his birthday, with roaring cheers, from
the front of Leicester House, that he would put up a
statue of his father in the centre of the square. Since
that promise was made and forgotten, the famous ducal
mansion of the Duke of Chandos had been knocked to
pieces by the auctioneer’s hammer. On the princess’s
birthday, 19th November, 1748, there was again a
mob in front of the prince’s ‘palace’ in Leicester
Square, not only to congratulate him, but to witness
the uncovering of an equestrian statue of George <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>
This statue was one of the many which had adorned
the duke’s house, Canons, near Edgeware. Nobody
seems to know now at whose cost it was purchased
and put up. It is suggested that the prince, or his
semi-Jacobite friends, bought it, with the thought that,
irritated as George <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> might be by having a statue
erected to him by his son, he would be still more irate
at having one erected of his father. The fact is that
the statue was bought and set up by subscriptions of
the inhabitants of the square. The unveiling of the
‘Golden Horse and Man’ was witnessed by a brilliant
company at the windows of Leicester House, among
whom was the Duke of Chandos himself, Groom of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
Stole to the Prince. Hogarth and other celebrities,
doubtless, looked on, from other windows of houses in
the square. This was the statue which in later days so
ignominiously perished; which dropt its arms, lost its
limbs, fell from its horse; and which ultimately was
swept away, horse and rider, in 1874, under a storm
of sarcasm and contempt.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>AN ECCENTRIC JACOBITE.</i></div>

<p>From this record of London in the Jacobite times
must not be omitted the death of a most remarkable
Jacobite, of whom little is remembered. This was Mr.
John Painter, of St. John’s, Oxford. This Jacobite
scholar made three several attempts, by letter, to induce
the Government to allow him to be beheaded in place
of Lord Lovat! Mr. Painter asked it as a particular
favour. The ministers were not amiable enough to
grant his prayer, and he was never happy afterwards.
Just previous to his death, he forbade his executors to
bury him near any of his relations. He urged them to
obtain permission for his corpse to hang in chains over
the spot where Lovat’s head was struck off. On being
questioned as to his reasons, he replied vaguely, that he
had not been guilty of any baseness, but he had committed
a fatal error in judgment which had led to
Lovat’s destruction. He did not define it; he left
complimentary farewells to Lord Chesterfield and Mr.
Pelham, and an expression of pity for Lovat’s son.
‘That unfortunate gentleman,’ said Painter, ‘suffers not
only through his father’s folly, but through mine.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>GLOOMY REPORTS.</i></div>

<p>As the year drew to an end, adverse parties quarrelled
over the terms of the peace of Aix la Chapelle;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
but this matter was forgotten in the news which reached
London that the young Chevalier had been literally
seized ‘neck and heels’ at the Paris Opera house, and
deposited at Vincennes, as a preliminary to turning him
out of France. About the same time his conqueror, the
Duke of Cumberland, quietly returned to London from
the continent. He came post from the coast to Lambeth,
where he took a boat from which he landed at
Whitehall; and thence he quietly walked across the
park, to St. James’s. He was warmly greeted on his
way, especially by that part of the garrison from Carlisle
which had reached the metropolis before their
fellows.</p>

<p>Rumours of fresh outbreaks by the Jacobites had
been freely circulated in London from the moment of
the suppression of the last. The sight of the Duke of
Newcastle, entering Leicester House, one November
day, gave rise to a report with which London was
speedily busied. ‘It was owing,’ writes the Countess of
Shaftesbury, in the ‘Malmesbury Correspondence,’ ‘to
a message from the Prince of Wales, that he had something
of importance to communicate; and he accordingly
laid before him the intelligence he had received
of a new rebellion forming, and almost ready to break
out in the Highlands. The Duke assured His Royal
Highness that his Majesty would take very kindly this
information, which he observed to concur exactly with
the accounts sent to the Government above a month
ago. I heartily wish this may produce a union between
the King and people which, sure, can never be more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
necessary than at this crisis, when new dangers threaten
us from the untamable bigotry of the Scotch Jacobites,
encouraged, perhaps, by the insolence of their friends
in many parts of England.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE HAYMARKET THEATRE.</i></div>

<p>‘The great Duke’ seems to have been among the
very simple people who, in February, 1749, were drawn
to the Haymarket Theatre by the promise of ‘the
Bottle Conjuror,’ to jump into a quart bottle in presence
of the audience. When the matter proved to be a
hoax, and the audience were further insulted by a loud
announcement from behind the curtain that, if they
would sit quiet till the following night, the conjuror
would jump into a pint bottle, a riot ensued in which
the interior of the house was absolutely destroyed. In
the confusion, the duke was seen looking for his sword;
and it is said that an audacious Jacobite called out,
‘Billy the Butcher has lost his knife!’ The alleged
loss was certainly made known by a satirical Jacobite,
in the following advertisement:—‘Lost on Monday
night, at the Little Play House in the Haymarket, a
Sword, with a gold Hilt and a cutting Blade, with a
crimson and gold Sword-knot tied round the Hilt.
Whoever brings it to Mrs. Chenevix’s Toy-shop, over-against
Great Suffolk Street, near Chearing Cross, shall
receive thirty Guineas reward, and no Questions asked.’
This advertisement, with its reference to the Court toy-woman,
offered fair opportunity for further Jacobite wit
or venom to show itself; and the demonstration was
made in the following manner:—‘Found entangled in
the Slit of a Lady’s Smock Petticoat, a gold-hilted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
Sword of martial length and temper, nothing the worse
for wear;—with the Spey curiously wrought on one
side of the blade, and the Scheldt on the other;—supposed
to have been stolen from the plump side of a
great General, in his precipitate retreat from the Battle
of Bottle Noodles, at Station Foote. Enquire at the
Quart Bottle and Musical Cave, Potter’s Row.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>TREASONABLE PAMPHLETS.</i></div>

<p>In the same month, there was a loosening of the
bonds of some condemned Jacobites and a tightening
of others; a releasing of old prisoners and a netting of
new;—with a recapturing of Jacobite exiles who had
been glad to leave the country, but who had come
secretly back again. Half-a-dozen of the Carlisle and
Manchester officers left the Southwark gaol for Gravesend,
on their way to America. The more audacious
of them wore white rosettes in their hats, in proud
assertion of their unbending principles. Quite as
audacious was the republication, at the price of 6<abbr title="pence"><i>d.</i></abbr>, of
the regicidal pamphlet, by Col. Titus,—‘Killing no
Murder, a Discourse proving it lawful to kill a tyrant.’
Another pamphlet,—‘A Letter from a Friend in the
Country to a Friend at Will’s, on the 3 new articles
of War,’ with the epigraph, from Waller’s ‘Maid’s
Tragedy Altered’—was much to the same <span class="lock">purpose:—</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>MURRAY AND LORD TRAQUAIR.</i></div>

<p>There was a less serious incident of the year which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
probably amused both Jacobites and Hanoverians.
Mr. Murray of Boughton and the Earl of Traquair had
come out of the late perilous time, with their necks
safe. The two liberated Jacobites were not the better
friends for their good fortune. They had a desperate
quarrel, which led Murray to air his bravery by sending
the earl a challenge to fight a duel. Lord Traquair,
having no stomach for fresh perils, indicted
Murray in the King’s Bench, for inciting to a breach of
the peace. A verdict of <em>Guilty</em> brought on him stern
rebuke, and led to his ultimate withdrawal into
privacy in Scotland.</p>

<p>On the part of institutions as well as of individuals,
there was a sort of anxiety to advertise their loyalty.
When the fireworks in St. James’s Park were about to
be exploded in celebration of the Peace of Aix la
Chapelle, many of ‘the Quality’ desired to see the
display, from the windows of St. George’s Hospital.
The ruling powers there, by no means, wanted such
company; but being afraid of a charge of disloyalty
being levelled against them, if they refused, the Board
made an explanation thus singularly worded:—‘Whereas
it is apprehended that many persons will be
desirous to see the fireworks from St. George’s Hospital,
this is to inform them there are but two wards
from which they can be seen; that these are women’s
wards, and that most of the patients in them are in
very dangerous disorders. It is therefore hoped that,
for Decency’s sake, for sake of the Patients, and indeed
for their Own sake (it not being at all certain that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
some of the Disorders are not catching), it will not be
taken amiss that no person whatever can be admitted.

<div class="sidenote"><i>POLITICAL MEETING.</i></div>

<p>At this time, the Pretender’s chief agent in England
was Dr. William King, Vice-Principal of St.
Mary Hall, Oxford, and public orator. At the opening
of the Radcliffe Library, the ultra-Jacobite orator
made a speech, in his official capacity. The ‘General
Advertiser’ says that ‘it was a most eloquent speech of
an hour long; and it met with great applause.’ Other
journals describe it as ‘an elegant oration.’ Walpole,
however, says: ‘The famous Dr. King, the Pretender’s
great agent, made a most violent speech at the opening
of the Radcliffe Library. The Ministry denounced
judgment but, in their old style, have grown frightened,
and dropt it.’ Then follows this singular illustration
of the men and times:—‘This menace gave occasion
to a meeting and union between the Prince’s party and
the Jacobites which Lord Egmont has been labouring
all the winter. They met at the St. Alban’s Tavern,
near Pall Mall, last Monday morning, a hundred and
twelve Lords and Commoners. The Duke of Beaufort
opened the ceremony with a panegyric on the stand
that had been made this winter, against so corrupt an
administration, and hoped it would continue, and
desired harmony. Lord Egmont seconded this strongly,
and begged they would come up to Parliament early
next winter. Lord Oxford spoke next, and then Potter,
with great humour, and, to the great abashment of the
Jacobites, said he was very glad to see this union, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
from thence hoped that if another attack, like the last
Rebellion, should be made on the Royal Family, they
would all stand by them. No reply was made to this;
then Sir Watkin Williams spoke, Sir Francis Dashwood,
and Tom Pitt, and the meeting broke up.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>DR. KING’S ORATION.</i></div>

<p>Walpole says that ‘the great Mr. Dodington’ gave
the assistance of his head to this conference; but there
is no notice taken of it in Dodington’s ‘Diary.’</p>

<p>With regard to Dr. King’s oration, which was published
as he delivered it, in Latin; and also in an English
translation, by a friend,—it is elegant throughout,
and harmless also, except perhaps in the closing paragraphs,
in which the Ministry found offence. Dr.
King, after deploring the universal corruption, wickedness,
misery, and misgovernment which reigned without
check or restraint, goes on to hope for a return or restoration
of men, measures, and incorruptible virtue,
whereby the nation might recover its wrecked honour
and happiness. Here is a sample of one of the four
paragraphs with which the oration closes:—‘<span class="smcap">Redeat</span>
(necque me fugit hoc verbum meum, quippe meum, ab
inficetis et malevolis viris improbari iterandum est
tamen), Redeat nobis Astræa nostra, aut quocunque nomine
malit vocari ipsa Justitia: non quidem fabulosa
illa, sed Christianissima Virgo, si non genitrix, certe
equidem custos virtutum omnium.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE EARL OF BATH.</i></div>

<p>No doubt the ‘redeat’ had direct reference to the
hoped-for return of the ‘king’ at Rome, for whom
good wishes were offered up in the London toast—‘The
Royal Exchange,’—a toast which is really a summary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
of Dr. King’s closing paragraphs. At this time the
London papers were busy with reporting the movements
of that king’s son—the young Chevalier. He
had promised the municipality of Friburg to take up
his residence there. The magistracy had invited him, not
having the fear of the English Government before their
eyes. Charles Edward broke his promise, upon which
the magistrates (according to a letter from Friburg in
the London papers) sharply reproached him for having
caused them to offend the King of England by an
invitation which came to nothing. Why he should
prefer Avignon to Friburg they could not understand.
The latest notice of his movements in the metropolitan
journals was that he was living <em>incognito</em> at Venice.
There was manifestly some uneasy curiosity about him,
and a desire on the part of the loyal citizens to be prepared
for anything that might turn up in the chapter of
accidents or conspiracies. The Earl of Bath only
expressed the general feeling of the city, if not of the
country, when he said, in a debate on the Mutiny Bill
in the Lords, ‘A parcel of rascally Highlanders
marched from the northernmost part of Scotland
through millions of people to within 100 miles of
London, without meeting with any resistance from the
people; and might, for what I know, have marched to
London, and overturned our government, had we had
no regular troops to prevent it;—a manifest proof that
a standing army is absolutely necessary.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE LAUREATE’S ODE.</i></div>

<p>The loyal Muse was at Court, as usual, on New
Year’s day, 1750, when the royal family and a brilliant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
array of privileged peers and peeresses assembled
to hear the annual ode of the laureate ‘set to Music.’
There was nothing in it like the ring of a hearty
Jacobite song. The more Cibber piled his loyalty, the
more ridiculous he became, as may be seen by the
sample of a single brick out of the lumbering <span class="lock">edifice:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent4">When the race of true Glory</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">Calls Heroes to start,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Then the Muse meets a story</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">Well worthy of Art.</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Had her Pindar of old</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">Known our Cæsar to sing</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">More rapid his raptures had roll’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">But;—Never had Greece such a king.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>All that Whigs and Cibber’s friends could say for
such tuneless and burlesque lines was that he made
them so on purpose. Jacobites replied to them less
fiercely than Johnson, but yet not without wit. For
instance, on seeing a tobacco pipe lit with one of the
laureate’s <span class="lock">odes:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">While the soft song that warbles George’s praise</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From pipe to pipe the living flame conveys,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Critics, who long have scorn’d, must now admire,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For who can say his Ode now wants its fire!</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE JACOBITE MUSE.</i></div>

<p>The laureate’s odes could neither make people
loyal, nor keep them so. On the other hand, the
Jacobite Muse, with her petticoat busked up to her
knee, was as brisk and winning as Maggie Lauder,
especially in Scotland. She gave much concern to the
people at St. James’s and the Cockpit, from the beginning
to the end of the year. She was working mischief<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
in the north. How matters were going on there,
and how different was the treatment of the Scotch
Muse, in December, from that of England before the
throne of George, at St. James’s, in the preceding
January, is told in the London papers. Captain
Stafford, of Pulteney’s Foot, was stationed in Aberdeen,
where the Jacobite Muse was rampant. The captain
seized the singers of treasonable ballads in the streets,
and brought them, with ballads and publishers, before
the magistrates. These were Jacobites, and they could
see no harm in the minstrels or the muse; and they
discharged the peripatetic singing agents of the young
Chevalier. They would not even confiscate the ballads.
This the loyal captain took upon himself to do;
he brought the whole mass of harmonious treason
from the printer’s to the Market Place, and set fire to
the ton of songs that was intended to raise one. While
they were burning he made a speech, of which this is
one of the flowers:—‘May all the enemies of His Most
Sacred Majesty, King George, our rightful and lawful
King, be consumed off the face of the earth, as the fire
consumeth these vile and treasonable ballads.’ For
which the captain was much commended in and about
St. James’s.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>PRISONS AND PRISONERS.</i></div>

<p>The disloyal muse was not silent in London. Macdonald,
‘said to be an Irish priest,’ made the echoes of
a Jacobite tavern in George Street, Bloomsbury, reecho
with treasonable songs till he was flung into Newgate,—which
then was a sentence of death. The
gaol-fever was then destroying prisoners, judges, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
witnesses, and sweeping life out of hundreds of homes
in the vicinity. While suppressing chords of a lyre
which was soon re-strung, a certain sort of service was
not forgotten. ‘We hear,’ says the ‘Penny Post,’ ‘that
a pension of 400<abbr title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr> per annum is settled on a person
eminently concerned in the late Rebellion, for services
done by him.’ The Government treated Lovat’s son
with justice,—gave him a free pardon, he having been
an unwilling rebel. As for emptying the London
prisons of convicted rebels, they seemed to be filled as
fast as they were emptied. Some of the captives were
sent over the Atlantic, others were allowed to transport
themselves, and many were set free altogether. A
little matter, however, could cast a man into a dungeon.
The ‘Daily Post’ (in July) records that ‘A
Person of Note has arrived in Town, in the Custody of
a Messenger, from Scotland. He is accused of seditious
Practises, particularly in encouraging the use of the
Highland Dress.’ A good look-out was kept at the
Tower, which was undergoing repair, and sentinels
showed much alacrity in firing on, or over, people who
approached too near the Tower ditch after sun-set.</p>

<p>This year is one of several assigned to a secret visit of
the young Chevalier and a friend to the exterior of the
Tower. As very few people really knew where he was
residing, this story was probably invented. The London
papers said of Charles Edward, in the spring, ‘It
is currently reported that the young Pretender, who
lately made such a disturbance in these kingdoms, died
a few days ago in Switzerland.’ However, the prince<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
was alive again in June. In that month the London
and Paris journals were treating of a trade riot which
was being turned to political purposes. In June, soon
after the king left London for Hanover, the metropolis
was disturbed by a report that a body of Northumberland
colliers, to the amount of six thousand, had left
the pits and had scattered themselves among the hills
and about the border. Out of what seems to have been
a mere strike, the ‘Gazette de Hollande’ made an
incipient insurrection. On the faith of its Jacobite
correspondent in London, it announced that one of the
leaders of the colliers had ascended a hill, and in
presence of his followers had proclaimed Charles
Edward as ‘King of England, France, and Ireland,’
and ‘<em>Defender of the Faith</em>,’ to which the devout pitmen
had replied with a fervent ‘Amen!’</p>

<div class="sidenote">‘<i>DEFENDER OF THE FAITH.</i>’</div>

<p>‘Defender of the Faith!’ What could this mean?
It is the first ‘inkling’ of the young Chevalier’s playing
with his ‘orthodoxy.’ The ‘fermentation’ puzzled a
French journalist, who, at the close of June, wrote
thus: ‘Prince Edward (<i lang="la">sic</i>) keeps up an intercourse with
secret correspondents in England; and one does not absolutely
know in what corner of Europe he is residing. He
is said to have gone over the whole of the North. He
is an extraordinary and indefatigable man; and travels
twenty leagues a-foot, with a couple of confidential
followers. If he were daring enough to pass into Scotland,
during the King of England’s absence, what,
without a party on which he can depend, will he be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
able to accomplish, wanting (as he does) arms and
money, and especially <em>without having publicly embraced
the Anglican religion</em>?’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>NEWS FOR LONDON.</i></div>

<p>Had Charles Edward then <em>privately</em> become a
member of the Protestant Church of England? Did
the London correspondent of the ‘Gazette de Hollande’
know anything of an intention to that effect? However
this may be, it is certain that in the autumn of this
year we have the record, true or false, of the presence
of the young Chevalier in London, and of his renunciation
of Roman Catholicism, <em>privately</em>, however, and
under an assumed character, in one of the London
churches!</p>

<p>In December the same journals chronicle as a
notable incident, ‘That the Chevalier de St. George
and his Son (call’d Cardinall of York) had a long
audience of the Pope, a few days ago, which ’tis pretended
turn’d upon some despatches, receiv’d the day
before from the Chevalier’s eldest Son.’ Whatever
these despatches contained, loyal Londoners hugged
themselves on the fact that the Princess of Wales was
taking her part in annually increasing the number of
heirs to the Protestant Succession, and loyal clerics
expounded the favourite text (Prov. xxix. 2), ‘When
the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice.’
Preachers of the old Sacheverel quality took the other
half of the verse, ‘When the wicked beareth rule, the
people mourn.’ These were convenient texts, which
did not require particularly clever fellows to twist
them in any direction.</p>

<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER <abbr title="Twelve">XII.</abbr></h2>
<h3>(1751 to 1761.)</h3>
</div>


<p class="drop-img unindent"><span class="drop-img"><img alt="f" src="images/drop_f.jpg" width="75"></span>
<span class="smcap">rom</span> the year 1751 to the coronation of
George <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> (1761), the London Parliament
and the London newspapers were
the sole sources from which the metropolitan
Jacobites, who were not ‘in the secret,’ could
obtain any information. There were two events in the
earlier year which in some degree interested the
Jacobite party. The first was the death of Frederick,
Prince of Wales. His way of life has been mercilessly
censured, but, considering the standard of morals of his
time, it was not worse than that of contemporary
princes. It was quite as pure as that of Charles
Edward (the Jacobite ‘Prince of Wales’), with whom
ultra-Tories disparagingly compared him. Many lies
were told of him, cowardly defamers knowing that a
prince cannot stoop to defend himself from calumny.
It was assumed that he was of the bad quality of the
worthless, scampish men who were among his friends.
The assumption was not altogether unjustifiable. ‘He
possessed many amiable qualities,’ said Mrs. Delany,
speaking for the aristocracy. ‘His condescension was
such that he kept very bad company,’ said a May Fair<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
parson on the part of the church. The well-known
Jacobite epigram not only refused to be sorry at his
death, but declared that had it been the whole royal
generation, it would have been so much the better for
the nation. The press chronicled the event without
comment. On ‘Change, the Jacobites openly said, ‘Oh,
had it only been the butcher!’ A few weeks later
everybody was drinking ‘the Prince of Wales’—George
or Charles Edward.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>DEATH OF GREAT PERSONAGES.</i></div>

<p>The other death was that of Viscount Bolingbroke,
which occurred in the last month of the year 1751.
Bubb Dodington reflected the general indifference, by
the simple entry in his Diary, ‘<abbr title="December">Dec.</abbr> 12. This day
died Lord Bolingbroke.’ The newspapers said little
more of the pseudo-Jacobite than they had said of the
prince. It amounted to the sum of Mrs. Delany’s
testimony, and ‘<em>she</em> remembered Lord Bolingbroke’s
person; that he was handsome, had a fine address, but
that he was a great drinker, and swore terribly.’ His own
treachery to the Chevalier de St. George caused more
than one honest Jacobite to be suspected of treason to
his lawful king. He made the name odious, and
almost warranted the assertion of Burgess (an old
divine, a familiar friend of the St. John family), who
declared in all good faith, that God ever hated Jacobites,
and therefore He called Jacob’s sons by the
name of Israelites!</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE NEW HEIR TO THE THRONE.</i></div>

<p>The references to modern Jacobites in the Parliament
at Westminster began, however, now to be fewer
and far between. There was not, on the other hand,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
much additional respect expressed for ‘the happy
establishment.’ On an occasion in 1752, when 22,000<abbr title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr>
were about to be voted as a subsidy to the Elector of
Saxony, some of ‘<em>the electoral family</em>’ seem to have
been present in the House. Beckford, as outspoken as
Shippen of old, saw his opportunity and remarked: ‘I
am here as an English gentleman; as such, I have the
right to talk freely of the greatest subject of the King,
and much more of the greatest subject of any foreign
state. If there be any persons in the House, belonging
to any Princes of Germany, they ought not to be here;
and, if they are, they must take it for their pains;—for,
their presence, I hope, will not keep any member
in such an awe as to prevent him from freely speaking.’
The subsidy, however, was granted.</p>

<p>The principles of the men who surrounded the
young Prince of Wales became of absorbing interest,—for
pure, as well as party, reasons. Bubb Dodington,
in December, 1752, speaks in his Diary of an
anonymous manifesto, which was in fact a remonstrance
to the king from the Whig nobility and gentry,
against the method according to which the heir to the
throne was being educated; and also against the
arbitrary principles of the men then in power; but
especially that ‘there was a permanency of power
placed in three men whom they looked upon as dangerous;
and that these three men entirely trusted and were
governed by two others, one of whom had the absolute
direction of the Prince, and was of a Tory family, and
bred in arbitrary principles; and the other, who was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
bred a professed Jacobite, of a declared Jacobite
family, and whose brother, now at Rome, was a
favourite of the Pretender, and even his Secretary of
State. In short, the corollary was, that Murray,
Solicitor-General, and Stone, governed the country.’
A copy of this anti-Jacobite declaration reached the
king’s hands. ‘What was the effect,’ says the diarist,
‘I can’t tell; but I know they were very much
intrigued to find out whence it came, and who was the
author.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>LORD EGMONT ON JACOBITES.</i></div>

<p>In 1753, in the debate in the Commons on the
number of land forces to be raised and paid for during
that year, Lord Egmont made a speech, the immediate
report of which must have raised surprise and
anger in St. James’s Street and Pall Mall. That Lord
Egmont should denounce increase in the number of
men was to be expected, but the Jacobites hardly expected
from him such a blow as was dealt in the following
words:—‘I am sure the old pretence of Jacobitism
can now furnish no argument for keeping up a numerous
army in time of peace, for they met with such a
rebuff in their last attempt that I am convinced they
will never make another, whatever sovereign possesses,
as his Majesty does, the hearts and affections of <em>all the
rest</em> of his subjects, especially as they must now be
convinced, however much France may encourage them
to rebel, she will never give them any effectual assistance.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>IN BOTH HOUSES.</i></div>

<p>It is observable that the Jacobites began to be
spoken of in less unworthy tones by their antagonists<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
than before. The Pope and ‘Papists’ were referred
to in no unbecoming phrases. Indeed, the <em>English</em>
‘Catholics’ were never rancorously assailed. The
popular spirit was (and is) against that Ultramontanism
which would stop at no crime to secure its own triumph;
which recognises no law, no king, no country, but
Roman, and which, asserting licence for itself, is the
bitter and treacherous enemy of every civil and religious
liberty. The Earl of Bath reflected the better
spirit that prevailed when, in 1753, in the debate on
the Bill for annexing the forfeited estates in Scotland
to the Crown (which ultimately passed), he said, ‘I
wish national prejudices were utterly extinguished. We
ought to live like brothers, for we have long lived under
the same sovereign, and are now firmly united not only
into one kingdom, but into one and the same general
interest; therefore, the question ought never to be,
who are English? or, who are Scots? but, who are
most capable and most diligent in the service of their
King and Country.’</p>

<p>One reference to the rebellion was made in the
House of Commons, in 1754, in the debate on the
propriety of extending the action of the Mutiny Bill to
the East Indies. Murray, the Solicitor- (soon after the
Attorney-) General, observed, ‘His present Majesty will
not attempt it’ (proclaim martial law, under any circumstance,
independently of parliament), ‘as no such
thing was thought of during the late Rebellion,
notwithstanding the immense danger we should have
been in, had His Royal Highness and troops from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
Flanders been detained but a few weeks by contrary
winds.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>JACOBITE HEALTHS.</i></div>

<p>Although there was plotting in 1753, and mischief
was a-foot, and Government spies were far from having
an idle time of it, the royal family lived in comparative
quiet, save one passing episode connected with a
charge laid, in the month of March, against Bishop
Johnson, of Gloucester, Murray (Solicitor-General), and
Stone (one of the sub-preceptors to the Princes George
and Edward)—as Jacobites—of having had, as Walpole
puts it, ‘an odd custom of toasting the Chevalier
and my Lord Dunbar (Murray’s brother and one of
the Chevalier’s peers) at one Vernon’s, a merchant,
about twenty years ago. <em>The Pretender’s counterpart</em>
(the King) ordered the Council to examine into it.’
The accuser, Fawcett, a lawyer, prevaricated. ‘Stone
and Murray,’ says Walpole, ‘took the Bible, on their
innocence. Bishop Johnson scrambled out of the
scrape at the very beginning; and the Council have
reported to the King that the accusation was false and
malicious.’</p>

<p>Vernon was in reality a linen-draper. Few people
doubted the alleged drinking of Jacobite healths at his
house. The dowager Princess of Wales told Bubb
Dodington that her late husband had told her that
Stone was a Jacobite,—the prince was convinced of it,
and when affairs went ill abroad, he used to say to
her in a passion: How could better be expected when
such a Jacobite as Stone could be trusted?</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE ROYAL FAMILY.</i></div>

<p>Lord Harcourt, Prince George’s governor, was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
pedantic man, having no sympathies with the young.
My lord was not much of a Mentor for a young Telemachus.
He bored the prince by enjoining him to hold
up his head, and, ‘for God’s sake,’ to turn out his toes.
The tutors of Prince George, after his father’s death,
were in fact divided among themselves. Bishop Hayter,
of Norwich, and Lord Harcourt were openly at war
with Stone and Scott (the last put in by Bolingbroke),
who were countenanced by the dowager princess and
Murray, ‘so my Lord Bolingbroke dead, will govern,
which he never could living.’ Murray, and Stone, and
Cresset were Jacobites. Cresset called Lord Harcourt
a groom, and the bishop an atheist. The princess
accused the latter of teaching her sons, George and
Edward, nothing. The bishop retorted by declaring
that he was never allowed to teach them anything.
His chief complaint was that Jacobite Stone had lent
Prince George (or the Prince of Wales) a highly
Jacobite book to read, namely, ‘The Revolutions of
England,’ by Father D’Orléans; but the objectionable
work had really been lent by ‘Lady Augusta’ to
Prince Edward, and by him to his elder brother.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>PARLIAMENTARY ANECDOTES.</i></div>

<p>Tindal, the historian, remarks that about this very
year (1753) ‘a wonderful spirit of loyalty began to
take place all over the kingdom.’ The debates in the
two Houses at Westminster confirm this. The old
anxious tone was no longer heard. Not a single reference
to Jacobites and their designs can be found in the
reports of the proceedings in the Legislature. ‘High
Church,’ which was once a disloyal menace, became a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
subject of ridicule. Horace Walpole thus playfully
illustrated the ignorance of the High Church party in
a debate on the proposal to repeal the Jews’ Naturalization
Bill. ‘I remember,’ he said ‘to have heard a
story of a gentleman, a High Churchman, who was a
member of this House, when it was the custom that
candles could not be brought in without a motion regularly
made and seconded for that purpose, and an order
of the House pursuant thereto, so that it often became
a question whether candles should be brought in or
no, and this question was sometimes debated until the
members could hardly see one another, for those who
were against, or for putting off the affair before the
House, were always against the question for candles.
Now it happened, upon one of those occasions, that the
High Church party were against the affair then depending,
and therefore against the question for candles;
but this gentleman, by mistake, divided for it, and
when he was challenged by one of his party for being
against them, “Oh Lord!” says he, “I’m sorry for it,
but I thought that candles were for the church!”’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ATTEMPT TO MAKE ‘PERVERTS.’</i></div>

<p>Admiral Vernon, ‘the people’s man,’ supporting the
popular prejudice against the emancipation of the
Jews, said that if the Bill passed, rich Jews would
insist upon the conversion of everyone employed by
them, ‘and should they once get the majority of common
people on their side, we should soon be all
obliged to be circumcised. That this is no chimerical
danger, Sir, I am convinced from what lately happened
in my county. There was there a great and a rich<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
Popish lady lived in it, who, by connivance, had publicly
a chapel in her own house, where mass was celebrated
every Sunday and Holiday. The lady, out of
zeal for her religion, had every such day a great number
of buttocks and sirloins of beef roasted or boiled,
with plenty of roots and greens from her own garden,
and every poor person who came to hear mass at her
chapel was sure of a good dinner. What was the consequence?
The neighbouring parish churches were
all deserted, and the lady’s chapel was crowded, for as
the common people have not learning enough, no more
than some of their betters, to understand or judge of
abstruse speculative points of divinity, they thought
that mass, with a good dinner, was better than the
church service without one, and probably they would
judge in the same manner of a Jewish synagogue.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>DR. ARCHIBALD CAMERON.</i></div>

<p>In one sense Tindal’s view of the general increase
of loyalty was not ill-founded. There was, however,
an increase of Jacobite audacity also; but the Government
were as well aware of it as they were that the
Chevalier was hiding at Bouillon, and that the people
there were heartily sick of him. One proof of their
vigilance was made manifest in the spring of 1753.
On the 16th of April, at 6 o’clock in the evening, a
coach, with an escort of dragoons about it, and a captive
gentleman within, was driven rapidly through the
City towards the Tower. The day was the anniversary
of Culloden. The time of day was that when the
friends of the happy establishment were at the tipsiest
of their tipsy delight in drunken honour of the victory.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
It was soon known who the prisoner was. He was Dr.
Archibald Cameron, brother of <a id="alt"></a>Duncan Cameron, of
Lochiel. Duncan had joined Charles Edward, in obedience
to his sentimental prince, but with the conviction
that the insurrection would be a failure. Archibald
had followed his elder brother as in duty bound, and
the prince from a principle of allegiance. After Culloden
and much misery, they and others escaped to
France by the skin of their teeth. The King of France
gave Duncan the command of a regiment of Scots;
Archibald was appointed doctor to it, and each pretty
well starved on his appointment. Both were under
attainder, and subject to death, not having surrendered
before a certain date, or offered to do so after it.</p>

<p>Had Archibald remained quietly in France, his
life at least would have been in no danger; but in the
early part of 1753, he crossed to Scotland in the utmost
secrecy, and when he landed he had not the remotest
idea that the eye of Sam Cameron, a Government spy,
was upon him, by whom his movements were made
known to the Ministry at the Cockpit in Downing
Street. There can be no doubt that the doctor went
to his native land on a political mission. ‘He certainly,’
says Walpole, ‘came over with commission to feel the
ground.’ He always protested that he was there on
private business connected with the estate of Lochiel.
His enemies declared that the private business referred
to a deposit of money for the Jacobite cause, the secret
of the hiding-place of which was known to Archibald,
and that he intended to appropriate the cash to his own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
use. Had Cameron’s mission not been hostile to the
established government, he probably would have asked
permission to visit Scotland; and, more than probably,
he would have been permitted to do so. Be this as it
may, his namesake, the spy, betrayed him; and the
Justice Clerk of Edinburgh, washing his hands of the
business, sent the trapped captive to London, where he
arrived on the seventh anniversary of the decisive overthrow
of the Stuart cause, and while the ‘joyous and
loyal spirits’ were getting preciously hysterical in
memory thereof. The ‘quality,’ however, were supremely
indifferent ‘Nobody,’ writes Walpole, ‘troubled
their head about him, or anything else but Newmarket,
where the Duke of Cumberland is at present making a
campaign, with half the nobility, and half the money of
England, attending him.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>BEFORE THE COUNCIL.</i></div>

<p>In the Tower Dr. Cameron was allowed to rest
some eight and forty hours, and then a multitude saw
him carried from the fortress to where the Privy Council
were sitting. The illustrious members of that body
were in an angry mood. They were blustering in
their manner, but they stooped to flattering promises if
he would only make a revelation. When he declined
to gratify them, they fell into loud tumultuous threatenings.
They could neither frighten nor cajole him; and
accordingly they flung him to the law, and to the expounders
and the executants of it.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>TRIAL OF CAMERON.</i></div>

<p>Very short work did the latter make with the poor
gentleman. It is said that when he was first captured
he denied being the man they took him for. Now, on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
17th of May, he made no such denial, nor did he deny
having been in arms against the ‘present happy establishment.’
He declared that circumstances, over which
he had no control, prevented him from clearing his
attainder by a surrender on or before a stated day.
But he neither concealed his principles nor asked for
mercy. There was no intention of according him any.
Sir William Lee and his brother judges, the identity of
the prisoner being undisputed, agreed that he must be
put to death under the old attainder, and Lee delivered
the sentence with a sort of solemn alacrity. It was the
old, horrible sentence of partial hanging, disembowelling,
and so forth. When Lee had reached the declaration
as to hanging, he looked the doctor steadily in
the face, said with diabolical emphasis, ‘but <span class="allsmcap">NOT</span> till
you are dead;’ and added all the horrible indignities to
which the poor body, externally and internally, was to
be subjected. The judge was probably vexed at finding
no symptom that he had scared the helpless victim,
who was carried back to the Tower amid the sympathies
of Jacobites and the decorous curiosity of ladies
and gentlemen who gazed at him, and the gay dragoons
escorting him, as they passed.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE DOCTOR’S JACOBITISM.</i></div>

<p>Next day, and for several days, Jean Cameron, the
doctor’s wife, was seen going to St. James’s Palace, to
Leicester House, and to Kensington. She was admitted,
by proper introduction to majesty, to the dowager
Princess of Wales and to the Princess Amelia. The sunshine
of such High Mightinesses should ever bear with
it grace and mercy; but poor and pretty Jean Cameron<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
found nothing but civility, and an expression of regret
that the law must be left to take its course. She went
back to cheer, if she could, her doomed, but not
daunted, husband. He was not allowed pen and ink
and paper, but under rigid restrictions. What he wrote
was read. If it was not to the taste of the warders,
they tore up the manuscript, and deprived the doctor
of the means of writing. Nevertheless, he contrived to
get slips of paper and a pencil, and therewith to record
certain opinions, all of which he made over to his
wife.</p>

<p>It cannot be said that the record showed any
respect whatever for the king <i lang="la">de facto</i>, or for his
family. These were referred to as ‘the Usurper and
his Faction.’ The Duke of Cumberland was ‘the inhuman
son of the Elector of Hanover.’ Not that
Cameron wished any harm to them hereafter. He
hoped God would forgive, as he put it, ‘all my enemies,
murderers, and false accusers, from the Elector of
Hanover (the present possessor of the throne of our
injured sovereign) and his bloody son down to Sam
Cameron, the basest of their spies, <em>as I freely do</em>!’
He himself, he said, had done many a good turn to
English prisoners in Scotland, had also prevented the
Highlanders from burning the houses and other property
of Whigs, ‘for all which,’ he added, ‘I am like
to meet with a Hanover reward.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CHARLES EDWARD, A PROTESTANT.</i></div>

<p>On the other hand, the doomed man wrote in
terms of the highest praise of the old and young Chevalier,
or the King and Prince of Wales. There would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
be neither peace nor prosperity till the Stuarts were
restored. The prince was as tenderly affectioned as he
was brave, and Dr. Cameron knew of no order issued
at Culloden to give no quarter to the Elector’s troops.
As aide-de-camp to the prince, he must (he said) have
known if such an order was issued. On another subject,
the condemned Jacobite wrote: ‘On the word of
a dying man, the last time I had the honour of seeing
His Royal Highness Charles, Prince of Wales, he told
me from his own mouth, and bid me assure his friends
from him, that he was a member of the Church of
England.’ It is to be regretted that no date fixes ‘the
last time.’ As to the assurance, it proves the folly of
the speaker; also, that Cameron himself was not a
Roman Catholic, as he was reported to be.</p>

<p>From Walpole’s Letters and the daily and weekly
papers, ample details of the last moments of this unfortunate
man may be collected. They were marked
by a calm, unaffected heroism. ‘The parting with his
wife (writes Walpole) the night before (his execution)
was heroic and tender. He let her stay till the last
moment, when being aware that the gates of the Tower
would be locked, he told her so; she fell at his feet in
agonies: he said, “Madam, this is not what you promised
me,” and embracing her, forced her to retire;
then, with the same coolness, looked at the window till
her coach was out of sight, after which, he turned
about and wept.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CAMERON’S CREED.</i></div>

<p>On the following morning, the 7th of June, Dr.
Cameron expressed a strong desire to see his wife once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
more, to take a final leave, but this was explained to
him to be impossible. With a singular carefulness as
to his own appearance, which carefulness indeed distinguished
all who suffered in the same cause, he was
dressed in a new suit, a light coloured coat, red waistcoat
and breeches, and even a new bagwig! The
hangman chained him to the hurdle on which he was
drawn from the Tower to Tyburn. ‘He looked much
at the Spectators in the Houses and Balconies,’ say the
papers, ‘as well as at those in the Street, and he bowed
to several persons.’ He seemed relieved by his
arrival at the fatal tree. Rising readily from the
straw in the hurdle, he ascended the steps into the
cart, the hangman slightly supporting him under one
arm. Cameron, with a sort of cheerfulness, welcomed
a reverend gentleman who followed him,—‘a Gentleman
in a lay habit,’ says the ‘Daily Advertiser,’ ‘who
prayed with him and then left him to his private
devotions, by which ’twas imagined the Doctor was a
Roman Catholic, and the Gentleman who prayed with
him, a Priest.’ This imagining was wrong. On one
of the slips, pencilled in the Tower, and delivered to
his wife, the Doctor had written: ‘I die a member of
the Episcopal Church of Scotland, as by law established
before that most unnatural Rebellion began in 1688,
which, for the sins of this nation, hath continued till
this day.’ At Tyburn, moreover, Cameron made a
statement to the sheriff, that he had always been a
member of the Church of England. There was no
discrepancy in this, he was simply an active Jacobite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
Nonjuror.
<span class="sni"><i>THE LAST VICTIM.</i></span>
As the reverend gentleman who attended
him, hurriedly descended the steps, he slipped. Cameron
was quite concerned for him, and called to him from
the cart, ‘I think you do not know the way so well as
I do.’ Walpole says: ‘His only concern seemed to be
at the ignominy of Tyburn. He was not disturbed at
the dresser for his body, nor for the fire to burn his
bowels;’ but he remembered the emphatic remark of
his Judge, that the burning was to take place while he
was yet alive; and he asked the sheriff to order things
so that he might be quite dead before the more brutal
part of the sentence was carried out. The sheriff was
a remarkably polite person. He had begged Cameron,
after he had mounted into the cart, not to hurry himself,
but to take his own time: they would wait his
pleasure and convenience, and so on. The courteous
official now promised he would see the Doctor effectually
strangled out of life, before knife or fire touched
him. On which, Cameron declared himself to be
ready. It was at this juncture, the chaplain hurriedly
slipt down the steps. ‘The wretch,’ says Walpole,
who in doubt as to his Church, calls him ‘minister or
priest,’ ‘after taking leave, went into a landau, where,
not content with seeing the Doctor hanged, he let down
the top of the landau, for the better convenience of
seeing him embowelled.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>IN THE SAVOY.</i></div>

<p>Even such brutes as then found a sensual delight
in witnessing the Tyburn horrors were touched by the
unpretentious heroism of this unhappy victim. Some
of them recovered their spirits a day or two after, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
a man was pilloried at Charing Cross. They repaired
to the spot with a supply of bricks and flung them with
such savage dexterity as soon to break a couple of the
patient’s ribs. On the 9th of June at midnight, there
was a spectacle to which they were not invited. The
Government (wisely enough) were resolved that
Cameron’s funeral should be private. The body lay
where Lovat’s had lain, at Stephenson’s the undertaker,
in the Strand, opposite Exeter Change. A few Jacobite
friends attended and saw the body quietly deposited
in what the papers styled, ‘the great vault in
the precincts of the Savoy.’</p>

<p>It was in this month a report was spread that an
attempt had been made to blow up the Tower, from
which, perhaps, the legend has arisen that the young
Chevalier and a friend in disguise had been there to
see if it could not be done! ‘The Report,’ according
to the ‘Weekly Journal,’ ‘of a lighted match being
found at the door of the Powder Magazine in the
Tower was not true.’ A bit of burnt paper lying on
the ground within the Tower gave rise to a story which
agitated all London for a day or two;—and which will
be presently referred to.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A SCENE AT RICHARDSON’S.</i></div>

<p>How Dr. Cameron’s death affected both parties,
in London, is best illustrated by a well-known and
picturesque incident recorded by Boswell. Soon after
the execution, Hogarth was visiting Richardson, the
author of ‘Clarissa Harlowe.’ ‘And being a warm
partisan of George <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>, he observed to Richardson that
certainly there must have been some very unfavourable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
circumstances lately discovered in this particular case
which had induced the King to approve of an execution
for rebellion so long after the time when it was committed,
as this had the appearance of putting a man to
death in cold blood, and was very unlike his Majesty’s
usual clemency. While he was talking, he perceived
a person standing at a window of the room shaking his
head, and rolling himself about in a strange ridiculous
manner. He concluded that he was an idiot whom his
relations had put under the care of Mr. Richardson, as
a very good man. To his great surprise, however, this
figure stalked forward to where he and Mr. Richardson
were sitting, and all at once took up the argument, and
burst out into an invective against George <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>, as one
who, upon all occasions, was unrelenting and barbarous,
mentioning many instances. In short, he displayed
such a power of eloquence that Hogarth looked at him
with astonishment, and actually imagined that the idiot
had been at the moment inspired. Hogarth and Johnson
were not made known to each other at this interview.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CAMERON’S CASE.</i></div>

<p>Neither Hogarth nor Johnson knew the real facts
of this case. Cameron played a desperate game and
lost his stake. Scott, in the Introduction to Redgauntlet,’
declares that whether the execution of
Cameron was political or otherwise, it might have been
justified upon reasons of a public nature had the king’s
Ministry thought proper to do so. Cameron had not
visited Scotland solely on private affairs. ‘It was not
considered prudent by the English Ministry to let it be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
generally known that he came to inquire about a considerable
sum of money which had been remitted from
France to the friends of the exiled family.’ He had
also, as Scott points out, a commission to confer with
Macpherson of Cluny who, from 1746 to 1756, was
the representative or chief agent of the ‘rightful King,’
an office which he carried on under circumstances of
personal misery and peril. Cameron and Macpherson
were to gather together the scattered embers of disaffection.
The former, being captured, paid the forfeit
which was legally due. ‘The ministers, however,’
says Scott, ‘thought it proper to leave Dr. Cameron’s
new schemes in concealment, lest, by divulging them,
they had indicated the channel of communication
which, as is now well known, they possessed to all the
plots of Charles Edward. But it was equally ill-advised
and ungenerous to sacrifice the character of
the King to the policy of the administration. Both
points might have been gained by sparing the life of Dr.
Cameron, after conviction, and limiting his punishment
to perpetual exile.’ As it was, Jacobite plots continued
to ‘rise and burst like bubbles on a fountain.’ An
affectionate memory of Cameron was also transmitted
through the hearts of his descendants. In the reign
of Victoria, his grandson restored honour to a name
which, in a political point of view, had never been dishonoured.</p>

<p>In the royal chapel of the Savoy, the following inscription
is to be read on the wall beneath a painted glass
window:—<cite>In memory of Archibald Cameron, brother<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
of Donald Cameron of Lochiel, who having been attainted
after the battle of Culloden in 1746, escaped to
France, but returning to Scotland in 1753, was apprehended
and executed. He was buried beneath the Altar
of this Chapel. This window is inserted by Her Majesty’s
permission in place of a sculptured tablet which
was erected by his grandson, Charles Hay Cameron, in
1846, and consumed by the fire which partially destroyed
the Chapel in 1864.</cite></p>

<p>The window above referred to has six lights, and
each light now contains figures representing <i><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter</i>,
<i><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Philip</i>, <i><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul</i>, <i><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John</i>, <i><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> James</i>, and <i><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Andrew</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A MINOR OFFENDER.</i></div>

<p>As a sample of how minor offences on the part of
unquiet Jacobites were punished, the case may be cited
of the Rev. James Taylor, who was not allowed to
indulge his Jacobitism even in a compassionate form.
A beggar was arrested in his progress from house to
house. He was found to be the bearer of a recommendatory
letter from the Nonjuror Taylor, in which
it was stated that the bearer had fought on the right
side at Preston Pans and Culloden. For this offence
Mr. Taylor was tried, convicted, and heavily sentenced;—namely,
to two years’ imprisonment, a fine of 300<abbr title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr>,
and to find sureties for his good behaviour during the
next seven years, himself in 1000<abbr title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr>, and two others in
500<abbr title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr> each.</p>

<p>All this time, Parliament was perfectly tranquil.
There was no flash of anti-Jacobitism. There was
nothing in the debates but what partook of the lightest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
of summer-lightning. In the whole session of 1755,
there is but one allusion to Jacobites, and that took the
form of a wish that, ten years before, Scotland had been
as heavily oppressed as England was,—in that and
many a succeeding year,—in one special respect. Mr.
Robert Dundas, in the Commons’ debate on speedily
manning the Navy, insisted on the legality and propriety
of pressing seamen, and remarked: ‘How happy
it would have been for Scotland, in 1745, if all her
seamen had been pressed into the public service, in
order to man a few guard-ships, to prevent the landing
of those who, at that time, raised such a flame in the
country; and yet I believe that a press could not then
have been carried on without the aid of the military.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>SUSPICION AGAINST THE DUKE.</i></div>

<p>At this time there was one especial trouble in the
royal family. The dowager Princess of Wales had as
much dread of the conqueror at Culloden, as if he had
been the Jacobite prince himself. Her dominant idea
was that the really good-natured and now corpulent
duke would act Richard <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> towards the prince, her
son, if opportunity should offer. Bubb Dodington
says, in his Diary, May, 1755: ‘On my commending
the Prince’s figure, and saying he was much taller than
the King, she replied, yes; he was taller than his
uncle. I said, in height it might be so, but if they
measured round, the Duke had the advantage of him.
She answered, it was true; but she hoped it was the
only advantage that he ever would have of him.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE ANTI-JACOBITE PRESS.</i></div>

<p>In the following year, 1756, electioneering politics
found violent suggestion and expression. Walpole,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
referring to the clamour raised by the Jacobites, speaks
of ‘Instructions from counties, cities, boroughs, especially
from the City of London, in the style of 1641,
and really in the spirit of 1715 and 1745, (which) have
raised a great flame.’ On the other hand, Jacobites
and their manifestations were treated by the Whig
press with boundless contempt. For example, the
‘Contest,’ in 1757, flung this paragraph at the supposed
few <em>Jacks</em> now left in London to read it:—‘The
word <em>Jacobite</em> is <i lang="la">vox et prœterea nihil</i>. The Name survives
after the Party is extinct. There may be a few
enthusiastic Bigots who deem Obstinacy a Merit, and
who appear to be ungrateful for the Liberty and Security
they enjoy under the present Government, and
insensible of the Calamity and Oppression of the Government
they would be willing to restore. But their
Power is as inconsiderable as their Principles are detestable.
And many of them, had they an Opportunity
of accomplishing their proposed desires, would be the
last to put them in Execution; for they are mostly
influenced by an idle Affectation of Singularity, and
the ridiculous Pride of opposing the Common Sense of
their Fellow Citizens.’</p>

<p>In the same year, the ‘Independent Freeholder’
turned the question to party account, and divided the
people of England into three classes. It admitted
the diminished numbers of Jacobites, recorded their
disaffection, and also accounted for it. The three classes
were—Place Hunters, Jacobites, and English Protestants,
whether Whig or Tory. The ‘Freeholder’ described<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
the Jacobites as:—‘An Offspring of Zealots,
early trained to support the divine hereditary Right of
Men, who forfeited all Right by persisting to do every
Wrong. They are not considerable in Number; and
had probably mixed with the Mass of rational Men,
had not the continued Abuses of the Administration
furnished cause of Clamour, enabling secret Enemies of
the Constitution to cherish a groundless Enmity to the
Succession.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE CITY GATES.</i></div>

<p>As the reign of George <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> drew to a close, in the
autumn of 1760, a change came over the City of
London, which, to many, indicated a new era; namely,
the destruction of those City gates in the preservation
of which timid Whigs saw safety from the assaults of
Jacobites. <em>Read</em> announced the fate of those imaginary
defences, in the ‘Journal’ of August 2nd:—‘On
Wednesday, the materials of the three following City
Gates were sold before the Committee of Lands, to Mr.
Blagden, a carpenter, in Coleman Street; namely,
Aldgate, for 157<abbr title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr> 10<abbr title="shillings"><i>s.</i></abbr>; Cripplegate, for 91<abbr title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr>; and
Ludgate, for 148<abbr title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr> The purchaser is to begin to pull
down the two first, on the first day of September; and
Ludgate on the 4th of August, and is to clear away all
the rubbish, &amp;c., in two months from these days.’ In
two months, a new reign had begun, and the old gates
had disappeared.</p>

<p>But before proceeding to the new reign, there remains
to be chronicled how the ordinary London Jacobites
obtained news of <em>their</em> King, James, and <em>their</em>
Prince of Wales, Charles Edward.</p>

<h3>(1751 to 1761.)</h3>
</div>


<div class="sidenote"><i>THE OLD CHEVALIER AND THE CARDINAL.</i></div>

<p class="drop-img unindent"><span class="drop-img"><img alt="d" src="images/drop_d.jpg" width="75"></span>
<span class="smcap">uring</span> this decade, there was great anxiety,
on the part of the Jacobites in London, to
have news of their Prince. Of their ‘King’s’
whereabout they knew as much as the
papers could tell them. These anxious Jacobites who
eagerly opened the London journals for news from
Rome, of ‘the King’ or ‘Prince of Wales,’ were not
often rewarded for their pains. The ‘London Gazette,’
which chronicled the veriest small beer, had not
a word to say as to the Chevalier or his sons. The
other papers recorded, for the comfort or diversion of
readers, such paragraphs as these; namely, that Cardinal
York, on his brother’s birthday, had given a
grand entertainment to a brilliant company of Cardinals
and Ladies; and that Rome was more crowded
with English nobility than Hanover, even when King
George was in his electoral dominions. Some sympathy
was excited in Jacobite company, at the intelligence
that the Cardinal was recovering from ‘an attack
of Small Pocks,’ which had carried off thousands of
victims. As for <em>Prince Edward</em>, as the Cardinal’s
brother is often called in the papers, ‘his place of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
residence is not known, there being no other proof of
his being alive but the rejoicings of his father on his
son’s birthday.’ Next, ‘Read’ announced, no doubt
for the pleasure of some of its readers, ‘We hear from
Rome, by authentick hand, that Henderson has been
formally excommunicated for his “History of the Rebellion.”’
‘No one can tell in what place Prince
Edward resides,’ says another ‘authentick hand,’ ‘it is
currently reported that he is actually in Italy;’ and
again, ‘Some are ready to believe he is still <em>incog.</em> in
France.’ Then came ‘authentick’ news to London, of
ignoble quarrels between the Chevalier and his younger
son, squabbles about money, squabbles among their
friends in trying to reconcile them;—the Pope himself
being mixed up in the turmoil, and getting such grateful
return as usually falls to mortal mediators. The
father and son were at vulgar loggerheads on the
vulgar but important subject of money. Living together,
each wished that the other should contribute
more towards keeping up the household in as much
royal state as could be had for the money. Each also
wished the other to send away the confidential servants
that other most wished to keep, and neither would yield.
Subsequently, the London papers tell how the Cardinal
went off in a great huff and princely state, and how he
was received in the ‘Italian cities with guns, like a
king’s son,’ as he was held to be. The ‘King,’ his
father, is described as ‘greatly distressed, having always
counted on the affection of his son.’ At another time
came one of those scraps of news which always kept<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
alive a feeling of hope in the bosoms of Jacobites.
‘The Grand Pretender’ had been for two hours in
conference with the Pope, ‘on receipt of important
despatches from his Eldest Son and Heir, Edward.
The despatches are at present kept a secret.’ They
were supposed to be favourable to something, for the
younger son had promised to return. Probably some
tears fell from soft Jacobite eyes in London, at reading
that, as ‘the son tarried, the father stood patiently
waiting for him, in the Hall of his House, and wept
over him when he came.’ The good-natured Pope was
almost as much touched.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ROMAN NEWS IN LONDON PAPERS.</i></div>

<p>All the honours conferred on the Cardinal of York
in Rome, and all the royal and solemn ceremonies
which took place on the occasion, were duly reported
in the London papers. The father seems to have been
warmly desirous that dignities should be heaped on the
younger son’s head. The cardinal affected, perhaps
felt, reluctance. On his gracefully yielding, the ‘Grand
Pretender’ made him a present of a set of horses.</p>

<p>Reports of the death of Charles Edward had been
ripe enough. The suspense was relieved when, in
March, 1753, news reached London from Rome that
the old Pretender had received letters from his son,
with the information that the writer was well; but,
says the ‘Weekly Journal,’ ‘the Chevalier de St.
George don’t absolutely discover where his son is.’
That he had known of his son’s whereabout, from the
first, is most certain; but he didn’t absolutely discover
it to every enquirer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A SON OF ROB ROY.</i></div>

<p>A personage of some note was in London this year,
the eldest son of Rob Roy,—James Drummond Macgregor.
He seems to have previously petitioned
Charles Edward for pecuniary help, on the ground of
suffering from the persecution of the Hanoverian
government, and to have been willing to serve that
government on his own terms. In the introduction to
‘Rob Roy,’ Sir Walter Scott says that James Drummond
Macgregor made use of a license he held to come
to London, and had an interview, as he avers, with
Lord Holdernesse. ‘His lordship and the Under-Secretary
put many puzzling questions to him, and, as
he says, offered him a situation, which would bring
him bread, in the government’s service. This office was
advantageous as to emolument, but in the opinion
of James Drummond, his acceptance of it would have
been a disgrace to his birth, and have rendered him a
scourge to his country. If such a tempting offer and
sturdy rejection had any foundation in fact, it probably
related to some plan of espionage on the Jacobites,
which the government might hope to carry on by
means of a man who, in the matter of Allan Breck
Stewart, had shown no great nicety of feeling. Drummond
Macgregor was so far accommodating as to intimate
his willingness to act in any station in which
other gentlemen of honour served, but not otherwise;
an answer which, compared with some passages of his
past life, may remind the reader of Ancient Pistol
standing upon his reputation. Having thus proved
intractable, as he tells the story, to the proposals of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
Lord Holdernesse, James Drummond was ordered
instantly to quit England.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>JACOBITE PARAGRAPHS.</i></div>

<p>The son of Rob Roy, hated and suspected by the
Jacobites, got over to Dunkirk, but he was hunted
thence as a spy. He succeeded in reaching Paris,
‘with only the sum of thirteen livres for immediate
subsistence, and with absolute beggary staring him in
the face.’</p>

<p>The hopes of the friends of the Stuarts were encouraged
by a paragraph in the London sheets of 1754
stating, that though the Chevalier was suffering from sciatica,
he was well enough to receive a stranger (in June),
‘who, by the reception he met with, was supposed to
be a person of distinction. Two days later, the banker,
Belloni, had a long private conference with the Chevalier.
What passed was not known, but what followed
<em>was</em>; namely, a large sum of money was advanced by
the banker.’ It is easy to imagine how paragraphs like
the above stirred the pulses at the Cocoa Tree and at
St. Alban’s coffee-house.</p>

<p>The Jacobite interest was kept up in 1755 by paragraphs
which showed that the family were well with
such a civil potentate as the King of Spain, and with
such a religious one as the Pope. The King of Spain,
it was said, had conferred a benefice on Cardinal York,
worth 6,000 piastres yearly. In the autumn the London
papers announced that ‘The Chevalier de St.
George, who enjoyed the Grand Priory of England, of
the Religion of Malta, which gave him an active and
passive voice in the election of Grand Master, had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
resigned it, and conferred it on a Commander Altieri.
The collation has been confirmed by the Pope.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>HUME’S ‘HISTORY.’</i></div>

<p>In the same year London was stirred by the publication
of Hume’s ‘History of England,’ which was
denounced as a Jacobite history by the Whigs, and it
was not warmly received by the Jacobites, as it did not
sufficiently laud their historical favourites. ‘It is called
Jacobite,’ wrote Walpole to Bentley, ‘but in my
opinion it is only not <em>George-abite</em>. Where others
abuse the Stuarts, he laughs at them. I am sure he
does not spare their ministers.’</p>

<p>But it was still to the news sent from Rome that
the Jacobites looked most eagerly for indications of
what might be doing there, and the significance of it.
Under date of January 3, 1756, the paragraph of news
from Rome, the Eternal City, in the ‘Weekly Journal,’
informed all who were interested, that an Irish officer
had arrived there with letters for the Chevalier de St.
George, had received a large sum of money, on a bill of
exchange, from Belloni, and had set out again with the
answers to those letters. Again, on January 17th, the
Chevalier’s friends in London were told that two
foreigners had called on him with letters, but that he
refused to receive either. ‘He refused to yield to their
most earnest entreaties for an interview.’ ‘Read’ communicates
a no less remarkable circumstance to the
Jacobite coffee-houses. ‘Tho’ people have talked to
him very much within the last two months of an expedition
on Scotland or Ireland, he has declared that
those kind of subjects are no longer agreeable to him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
and that he should be better pleased to hear nothing
said about them.’ Then came news of the Chevalier
being sick, and the Pope, not only sending his own
physician, but stopping his coach to enquire after the
exile’s health. Occasionally, the paragraph of news is
communicated by a ‘Papist,’ as, for instance, in an
account of the reception into the Church of Rome of
the young son of the Pasha of Scutari, where it is said
that Cardinal York performed the ceremony of receiving
the dusky convert, who had abandoned a splendid position
‘to come,’ says the writer, at Rome, ‘and embrace
our holy religion.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>AT ROME.</i></div>

<p>For the purpose of reading such intelligence, the
Jacobites opened feverishly the sheet which oftenest
satisfied their curiosity. This had to be satisfied with
little. Throughout ’56 and ’57 they learnt little more
than that the Pope had been ill, and that the Chevalier
and the Cardinal drove daily from their villas to leave
their names at the dwelling of the Pontiff. Next, that
the quaint Jacobite, Sir William Stanhope, had actually
had an audience of the Pope, to whom he had presented
a gold box full of rhubarb; and reasons were
assigned why the contents might prove more useful
than the casket. Then, clever English lords had established
themselves in great magnificence in Roman
palaces, or in villas as magnificent as palaces; and, still
more encouraging news for the Cocoa Tree and St.
Alban’s coffee-house, the King of Spain had increased
the income of Cardinal York by 1,200 crowns yearly,
drawn from the revenue of the bishopric of Malaga.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
On the north side of Pall Mall, and on the lower terrace
of the west side of St. James’s Street, or beneath
the Walnut tree walk in Hyde Park,—places still much
affected by Jacobites, imagination may see them wearing
congratulatory looks on the English lords collecting
near the Chevalier, and the Spanish monarch contributing
money to the Cardinal. If these things were
without significance, where should they look for incidents
that would bear cheerful interpretation?</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>HOPES AND INTERESTS.</i></div>

<p>Then ensued long silence, broken only by brief
announcements of archiepiscopal (and other) honours
heaped upon Cardinal York, and of splendid dinners
in the Quirinal, with Pope and all the Cardinals,
strong enough to sit up, as the joyous host and guests.
Not a word, however, is to be traced with reference to
Charles Edward; nor was it looked for, at the time,
by the ‘quality,’ who were contented with ‘the happy
establishment.’ On Christmas Day of this year, Walpole
wrote: ‘Of the Pretenders family one never hears
a word. Unless our Protestant brethren, the Dutch,
meddle in their affairs, they will be totally forgotten;
we have too numerous a breed of our own to need
princes from Italy. The old Chevalier ... is likely
to precede his rival (George <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>), who, with care, may
still last a few years; though I think he will scarce
appear again out of his own house.’</p>

<p>But the hopes and the interest of the London
Jacobites had to be maintained, and, through the London
papers, the hopes and the interest of the adherents
of the Stuarts, in the country. The aspirations of such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
sympathisers were hardly encouraged by an incident
of which Walpole made the following note, to Conway,
in January, 1759: ‘I forgot to tell you that the King
has granted my Lord Marischal’s pardon, at the request
of M. de Knyphausen. I believe the Pretender himself
could get his attainder reversed, if he would apply to
the King of Prussia.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ILLNESS OF THE OLD CHEVALIER.</i></div>

<p>In the Chatham Correspondence, it is stated that the
King of Prussia had said he should consider it a personal
favour done to himself. The pardoning of such
an able military Jacobite as Keith, Earl Marischal, indicated
that the ‘Elector of Hanover’ considered Jacobitism
as dead, or at least powerless. At the same
time, the more mysteriously secluded Charles Edward
kept himself, the more curiosity there was among
‘curious’ people in London to learn something about
him and his designs, if he had any. The apparently
mortal illness of the Chevalier de St. George, in May
1760, caused some of the London papers to publish a
sort of exulting paragraph, not over the supposed dying
Chevalier, but over the fact, announced in the words:
‘We shall soon know where the young Pretender is!’
Of the father’s impending death no doubt was made.
Was he not seventy-two years of age? And had he
not for thirty years of the time been worn out with
anxieties caused by his sons? One saucy paragraph
included the saucier remark:—‘He has left his estates,
which may be Nothing, to his eldest son, whom many
think is Nobody.’ But all this was premature. The
old prince did not die this year. George <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> <em>did</em>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
The grandson of the latter began to reign in October.
The Jacobites laughed at his new Majesty’s boast of
being born a Briton, for ‘James <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>’ was more purely
British than he; born in London, and son of a father
who was also born in this metropolis, he was less of a
foreigner than George <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>, whose parents were purely
German. The Jacobites made the most of this difference;
and when such of them as were in Hyde Park
saw the king’s horse nearly break his rider’s neck by
suddenly flinging him out of the saddle, those spectators
probably thought of the results of King William’s
fall from horseback, and hoped that heaven was on
their side. The newspapers admiringly recorded the
presence of mind of the young king, who, though
shaken, went to the play the same night, to calm the
supposed anxieties of his faithful people.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ACCESSION OF GEORGE <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr></i></div>

<p>Much as Jacobites had railed at the late ‘Elector of
Hanover and his bloody son,’ and had devoted both of
them to eternal perdition in hell, a sort of serio-comic
assurance that their malice was ineffective seems to
have been insinuated in the first words of the anthem,
set to music by Boyce, for the king’s (or the elector’s)
funeral; namely, ‘The souls of the righteous are in the
hands of God, and there shall be no torment touch
them.’ On the first occasion of George <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> going to
the Chapel Royal (Sunday, November 17th), the Rev.
Dr. Wilson took his text from Malachi i. 6, where the
prophet speaks of the rebellious spirit and irreligiousness
of Israel, a text which Nonjurors, and especially
the Nonjuring clergy, might well take to themselves.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
<span class="sni"><i>KING AND PEOPLE.</i></span>
After ‘Chapel’ there was a ‘Court.’ Of the latter, the
papers say: ‘By the insolence of the soldiers many
persons were not suffered to go into the Gallery. All
those that paid for seeing his Majesty were admitted,
a practice, it is hoped, will soon be put a stop to.’
The price of admission is not stated; but among those
who had gathered about the Park were nearly a
thousand tailors, who, rather than stoop to work for
five shillings a day, refused to work at all. The newspapers
protested that it was a thousand pities a press-gang
or two had not been in the Park to sweep these
fellows into the ships that lacked men. If they would
not work for themselves on liberal wages, they ought
to be compelled to serve their country on less. There
was no doubt about their bravery, for the London
tailors had, not long before, brilliantly distinguished
themselves under Elliot, at Gibraltar. The hint of the
amiable journalists was acted on, on the Coronation
day, in 1761. While the British-born king of a free
people, over whom, he said, he was proud to reign,
was being crowned (with his young queen) in the
Abbey, ruffianly press-gangs were making very free
with that people all around the sacred edifice; seizing
whom they would; knocking on the head all who resisted;
flinging them into vessels on the river, and so
despatching them to Gravesend, the Nore, and thence
to men-of-war on various stations!</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CHARLES EDWARD AT WESTMINSTER.</i></div>

<p>One visitor is alleged to have been present at this
coronation, who certainly was not an invited, nor would
he have been a welcome, guest. This visitor is said to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
have been Charles Edward himself! As he is also
credited with two or three earlier visits to London, the
question as to the truth of the reports may be conveniently
considered here.</p>

<p>We will only remark that, in the closing years of
the reign of George <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>, Jacobites, who had neither
been harmless nor intended to remain so if opportunity
favoured them, were allowed to live undisturbed.
As Justice Foxley remarked to Ingoldsby, they attended
markets, horse-races, cock-fights, fairs, hunts,
and such like, without molestation. While they were
good companions in the field and over a bottle, bygones
were bygones.</p>

<span class="smcap">subject</span> of great interest in the life of
Charles Edward presents itself to consideration
in the alleged romantic, but particularly
absurd, incidents of his various appearances
in London, or England. These doubtful
visits commence with the year 1744, and close with
the no longer <em>young</em> Chevalier’s supposed presence at
the coronation of George <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>, 1761.</p>

<p>In the former year, there was residing at Ancoats,
near Manchester, Sir Oswald Mosley, who had been
created a baronet by the Hanoverian king, George <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>,
in 1720. At the end of nearly a quarter of a century,
if common report do not lie, he seems to have been a
thorough Jacobite, with Charles Edward for his guest,
in disguise! The ‘fact’ is first recorded in Aston’s
‘Metrical Records of Manchester,’ in the following
doggrel <span class="lock">lines:—</span></p>

</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CHARLES EDWARD IN MANCHESTER.</i></div>

<p>A foot-note states that the prince was the guest of
Sir Oswald for several weeks, ‘no doubt, to see the
inhabitants of Manchester and its vicinity, who were
attached to the interests of his family.’</p>

<p>At that time, a girl was living in Manchester, who
was about fourteen years of age. For seventy succeeding
years she used to relate that in 1744, a handsome
young gentleman used to come from Ancoats
Hall into Manchester, every post day, to the inn and
post house of her father, Bradbury, for letters or to
read the papers from London, in which papers, as he
sat apart, he seemed to take unusual interest. The
girl admired his handsome countenance, his genteel
deportment, and the generous spirit which led him to
give her half-a-crown for some trivial chamber-maid
service. In the following year, when Charles Edward
marched past her father’s house at the head of his
troops, the girl made outspoken recognition of him as
the liberal donor of the welcome half-crown. The
father, ill-pleased at her demonstration, drove her in,
and silenced her with threats; but when all danger
had ceased to exist, he acknowledged that the handsome
young fellow with the genteel deportment and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
the young Chevalier were one and the same.—Such is
the substance of a corroborative story told by a later
Sir Oswald Mosley, Bart., in ‘Family Memoirs,’ printed
in 1849 for private circulation.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>MISS BYROM’S DIARY</i>.</div>

<p>In Miss Beppy Byrom’s Diary, she narrates an interview
which some of the leading Jacobites of Manchester
had with the prince when he was there in the ’45
rebellion. These included her celebrated father, John
Byrom, Deacon, the father of the unlucky young captain
who was afterwards executed on Kennington Common,
Clayton, and others. The day was St. Andrew’s Day,
Saturday, November 30th. Many ladies were making
crosses of St. Andrew; Miss Byrom dressed in white to
go and see the prince, who witched her with his noble
horsemanship. The horse seemed self-conscious of
bearing a king’s son. After the review, the lady and
others went to church. ‘Mr. Skrigley read prayers.
He prayed for the King and Prince of Wales, but
named no names.’ There was much mild dissipation
afterwards, with too much restlessness to partake of
settled meals, but infinite sipping of wine to Jacobite
healths. In the evening, after having seen the prince
at table, the lady and many companions drank more
healths in the officers’ room. ‘They were all exceeding
civil,’ she says, ‘and almost made us fuddled
with drinking the P.’s health, for we had had no dinner.
We sat there till Secretary Murray came to let us know
the P. was at leisure, and had done supper; so we all
had the honour to kiss his hand. My papa was fetched
prisoner to do the same, so was Dr. Deacon. Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
Cattell and Mr. Clayton did it without. The latter said
grace for him. Then we went out and drank his health
in another room,’ &amp;c., &amp;c. This record is quoted in
‘Notes and Queries,’ May 1, 1869, and as it makes no
reference to the alleged visit of 1744 (only one year
before), it may be taken as demolishing the earliest
legend of the legendary visits of Charles Edward to
England.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE VISIT IN 1748.</i></div>

<p>The next in order of date is a very undefined visit
of 1748. In support of it there appears that exceedingly,
questionable witness, namely, Thicknesse.</p>

<p>Crazy Philip Thicknesse, in his crazy Memoirs, on
the title-page of which he crazily announced that he
had the misfortune to be the father of George Thicknesse
Tuchet. Lord Audley (the son George had
succeeded to the ancient barony, through his deceased
mother) was the man who, on his son refusing to
supply him with money, set up a cobbler’s stall,
opposite the son’s house, with a board on which was
painted, ‘Boots and shoes mended in the best and
cheapest manner, by Philip Thicknesse, father of Lord
Audley.’ This had the desired effect. In the farrago,
called his Memoirs, Thicknesse says he knew ‘an Irish
officer who had only one arm.’ In a note, the name
<em>Segrave</em> is given as that of the officer; but this editorial
addition has been transferred to the text by all writers
who have quoted crazy Philip’s account. The officer
with only one arm assured Thicknesse that he had
been with the Prince in England, between the years
1745 and 1756, and that ‘<em>they</em>,’ Prince and one-armed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
officer, ‘had laid a plan of seizing the person of the
King, George <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>, as he returned from the play, by a
body of Irish chairmen, fifteen hundred of whom were
to begin a revolution, in Lincoln’s Inn Fields.’ Philip,
however, with a return of sense, remarks: ‘I cannot
vouch for the truth of this story.’ Yet out of this
unfounded story grew a report that Charles Edward
was in London in 1748, which was between the years
above named. Philip Thicknesse was in his 70th year
when he began to put together his book, which was
published in 1788. He reminds his readers, that he
‘never pretended to be an accurate writer.’ The
reminder was hardly necessary.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE VISIT IN 1750.</i></div>

<p>The next witness, in chronological order, is Dr.
King, the Chevalier’s great agent, who gives the year
1750, as that in which Charles Edward came to London.
This information was first furnished in a book which
was published in 1818, under the title, ‘Political and
Literary Anecdotes of his own time.’</p>

<p>The editor is anonymous. He gives this account
of how he came in possession of the MS. ‘A Friend’
(no name given) ‘who was a long time a prisoner in
France, met with the following work in the possession
of two ladies’ (not named, but who are described as)
‘relations of the writer, Dr. King. From the interesting
passages which he was permitted to extract, the
Editor’ (as destitute of name as the others) ‘conceived
that the original might be well worthy of publication,
he therefore desired his friend to procure it, and found,
on a comparison of the hand-writing with that which is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
well ascertained to be Dr. King’s, in the account books
of St. Mary Hall, in Oxford,—that there is every
reason to suppose this MS. to have been written by Dr.
King himself.’ Four nameless persons, and only ‘a
reason to suppose’ among them.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>DR. KING AND THE CHEVALIER.</i></div>

<p>Dr. King’s life extended from 1685 to 1763; and
it was towards the close of his life, that he collected
the anecdotes from the manuscript of which the editor
(1818) was permitted to take extracts. Where the
<a id="chg5"></a>original manuscript is to be found is not mentioned.
The only reference to the young Chevalier of any importance
is in the paragraph in which the writer leads
us to infer that the prince was in England in September,
1750, at Lady Primrose’s house. ‘Lady
Primrose,’ he says, ‘presented me to ——’ Why this
mysterious dash, when frequent mention is made of
Charles Edward, in description of character, as ‘the
Prince’ or ‘Prince Charles?’ It is also stated that the
prince was King’s guest, and was recognised by King’s
servants. For a Jacobite, the doctor is as severe a
dissector of the young Chevalier as the bitterest Whig
could desire. He speaks ill of the illustrious visitor,
morally and intellectually. As to his religion, King
says he was quite ready to ‘conform’ to the religion of
the country; that he was a Catholic with the Catholics,
and with the Protestants, a Protestant. This was
exactly what Lord Kilmarnock said before he was
executed. King further states that Charles Edward
would exhibit an English Common Prayer Book to
Protestant friends; to the Catholics he could not have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
afforded much pleasure by letting Gordon, the Nonjuror,
christen his first child, of which Miss Walkenshawe
was the mother. Such an easy shifting of livery,
from Peter’s to Martin’s, and back again to Peter’s, was
natural enough in the case of a man, who had been
brought up at Rome, but who was placed under the
care of a Protestant tutor, who of express purpose
neglected his education, and who, if King’s surmise be
correct, made a merit of his baseness, to the Government
in London, and was probably rewarded for it by
a pension. Dr. King speaks of the prince’s agents in
London, as men of fortune and distinction, and many of
the first nobility, who looked to him as ‘the saviour of
their country.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>MEMORANDA.</i></div>

<p>This visit to London in 1750, if it really was ever
made, is supposed to be referred to, in one of several
memoranda for a letter in the prince’s handwriting,
preserved with other Stuart papers, in Windsor Castle;
and first published by Mr. Woodward, Queen’s Librarian,
in 1864. It runs thus: ‘8thly. To mention
my religion (which is) of the Church of England as by
law established, as I have declared myself when in
London, the year 1750.’ This memorandum is at the
end of a commission from the writer’s father dated
1743, to which commission is appended a copy of the
‘Manifesto’ addressed by the prince to Scotland, in
1745. At what date the memorandum was written
there is no possibility of knowing. If the prince, as
was his custom, used only the initial of the name of the
city, it is possible that Liége was meant; and, after the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
word ‘when,’ the writer may have omitted the name
of one of his many agents of ‘fortune and distinction,’
who looked to him as the saviour of their country.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>FURTHER MEMORANDA.</i></div>

<p>There are other memoranda for letters, supposed
to refer to the above visit. For example:—‘Parted,
ye 2nd <abbr title="September">Sept.</abbr> Arrived to A, ye 6th, parted from
thence, ye 12th <abbr title="September">Sept.</abbr> E, ye 14th, and at L, ye 16th.
Parted from L, ye 22nd, and arrived at P. ye 24th.
From P, parted ye 28th, arrived here ye 30th <abbr title="September">Sept.</abbr>’
In this memorandum the initials are supposed to stand
for Antwerp, England, London, and Paris. There is
nothing to prove that they <em>do</em>; and, it may be said
that A and L quite as aptly represent Avignon and
Liége. However this may be, dates and supposed
places are entirely at variance from other dates and
places which are taken as referring to this identical
visit of the young Chevalier to London, in 1750. ‘Ye
5th <abbr title="September">Sept.</abbr> O.S. 1750, arrived; ye 11th parted to D, ye
12th in the morning parted and arrived at B, and ye
13th at P. R. S. ye 16th <abbr title="September">Sept.</abbr> ye 22nd, 23rd, and
24th.’ Here, D and B are interpreted as signifying
Dover and Boulogne, P. is Paris. R. S. have received
no interpretation. It is certain that one of the two
records <em>must</em> be incorrect; and both of them <em>may</em> be.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CHARLES EDWARD’S STATEMENT.</i></div>

<p>But, something more definite is reached in a
despatch from the British Minister at Florence (Mann),
which Lord Stanhope published in his ‘Decline of the
Stuarts.’ The minister, who writes in 1783, describes
a conversation which took place at Florence, between
Charles Edward (then known as Count d’Albany) and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
Gustavus, King of Sweden, in the course of which the
count told the king that, in September, 1750, he
arrived secretly in London with a Colonel Brett; that
together they examined the outer parts of the Tower,
and came to the conclusion that one of the gates might
be blown in by a petard. After which, at a lodging in
Pall Mall, where fifty Jacobites were assembled, including
the Duke of Beaufort and the Earl of Westmoreland,
the prince said to these Jacobites, or rather
to Gustavus, that if they could have assembled only
4,000 men, he would have publicly put himself at their
head. He added that he stayed a fortnight in London,
and that the Government were ignorant of his presence
there.</p>

<p>It is to be remembered that this story was told
three and thirty years after the alleged occurrence.
The narrator was then an aged man, whose brains and
memory and general health were so damaged by ‘the
drink, the drink, dear Hamlet!’ that not the slightest
trust could be placed in any single word that he uttered
in respect to his past history. He may have dreamed
it all, but that any two gentlemen, the face of one of
whom was familiar, from prints and busts publicly sold,
could have so carefully examined the Tower as to find
out where it was vulnerable, without the sentinels
having discovered the same part in the explorers, is
surely incredible. The vaunt of the secret visitor
publicly placing himself at the head of an army of
Jacobites, was just such a boast as the brainless drunkard
of 1783 would be likely to make. There is as little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
reliance to be put on the statement of the Duke of
Beaufort and Earl of Westmoreland being present at a
Jacobite meeting in Pall Mall. The really Jacobite
duke died in 1746. His successor, and also the Earl
of Westmoreland (of the year 1750), may have been
often in opposition to the Government, but no act of
their lives would warrant the belief that they could be
insane enough to attend a meeting of half a hundred
Jacobites in Pall Mall, to listen to a project for blowing
up the Tower and pulling down the throne.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE VISIT IN 1752-3.</i></div>

<p>Two years after 1750, however, according to the
MS. Journal of Lord Elcho, Charles Edward was again
in London, secretly at the house of the very outspoken
Jacobite lady, Lady Primrose. Hume, the historian,
says, in a letter to Sir John Pringle (dated 1773), that
he knew with the greatest certainty that Charles Edward
was in London in 1753; his authority was Lord Marischal,
‘who said it consisted with his certain knowledge.’
The knowledge was derived from a lady—whom
my Lord <em>refused to name</em>, and whom Hume
<em>imagined</em> to be Lady Primrose. Now, Lady Primrose
was the Protestant daughter of the Dean of Armagh,
of Huguenot descent, bearing the name of Drelincourt.
She was the widow of Viscount Primrose who had been
an officer of distinction in the king’s service. Lady
Primrose, herself, was a warm-hearted Jacobite who
had given a temporary home in Essex Street, Strand,
to Flora Macdonald, during part of her brief sojourn
in London in 1747. According to this legendary
visit of 1753, Charles Edward, unexpectedly, entered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
her room, when she was entertaining a company at
cards. He was there unannounced, yet Lady Primrose
called him by a name he assumed! Her object was
to keep him undetected by her friends; but his portrait
hung in the room, and the company identified
the visitor. Lord Marischal told Hume (he thinks,
‘from the authority of the same lady,’ whom Lord
Marischal had refused to name), that the Prince went
about the streets and parks, with no other disguise
than not wearing ‘his blue ribband and star.’ Some
years after, Hume spoke of this visit, to Lord Holdernesse
(who in 1753 was Secretary of State). This
minister stated that he received the first intelligence
of Charles Edward’s presence in London from George
<abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>; who may have been misinformed, and who is
reported to have said, ‘When he is tired of England,
he will go abroad again!’ A very unlikely remark.
Another story resembled that of the Lincoln’s Inn
Fields’ chairmen, namely, that in 1753, Lord Elibank,
his brother Alexander Murray, and five dozen associates,
were to be employed in carrying off this very
good-natured monarch!</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CREDIBILITY OF THE STORIES.</i></div>

<p>As to the credibility of this story, it is only necessary
to remark that, in 1753, Dr. Archibald Cameron
was hanged in London for being present in Scotland,
where mischief was intended; and that, if the Ministry
were so well served by their spies, such as Sam Cameron
was, through whom the Doctor was arrested
and executed, Charles Edward could not possibly have
escaped; and his capture was of great importance at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
the moment. Moreover, the king was powerless. It
belonged to the Administration to decide whether the
undisguised Prince should be captured or allowed to
go free.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CONFLICTING STATEMENTS.</i></div>

<p>Assuming that he was so allowed, he is again found
in London in 1754. At least, crazy Thicknesse says:
‘that this unfortunate man was in London, <em>about</em> the
year 1754, I can positively assert. He was “at a lady’s
house, in Essex Street;” was recognised in the Park,
by a Jacobite gentleman who attempted to kneel to
him, and this so alarmed the lady in Essex Street,
that a boat was procured the same night, in which he
was forthwith despatched to France. Tonnage of boat
and captain’s name not registered.</p>

<p>Later, the date of this last visit is given in a letter,
addressed by Lord Albemarle, British ambassador in
Paris, to Sir Thomas Robinson, namely, May 1754.
The writer, in August, 1754, states that he had been
‘positively’ assured by a discontented Jacobite, that
‘no longer ago than about three months,’ Charles
Edward had been in London, ‘in a great disguise as
may be imagined;’ that the prince had received
friendly notice, at Nottingham, that he was in danger
of being seized, and that he immediately fled. As to
the authority, Lord Albemarle writes:—‘The person
from whom I have this, is as likely to have been informed
of it as any of the party, and could have had
no particular reason to have imposed such a story
upon me, which could have served no purpose.’ The
ambassador is mistaken. The purpose of such stories<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
was to keep warm the hopes—fading hopes—of the
Jacobites, and it was not the last story invented with
that purpose in view.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>AT THE CORONATION.</i></div>

<p>Lastly, there is the story of the prince’s presence
at the coronation festival of George <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>, in 1761.
According to some authorities, it was without any
stirring incident. Others say, that very stirring matter
indeed sprang from it, and that much confusion was
the consequence.</p>

<p>Walpole, describing the illustrious people, state
officers, and others at the coronation-banquet of George
<abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>, September 1761, pauses at sight of the son of the
unhappy Lord Kilmarnock. ‘One there was ...
the noblest figure I ever saw, the High Constable of
Scotland, Lord Errol’ (he had succeeded to this title
through his mother), ‘as one saw him in a place capable
of containing him, one admired him. At the wedding,
dressed in tissue, he looked like one of the Giants in
Guildhall, new gilt. It added to the energy of his
person—that one considered him acting so considerable
a part in that very Hall, where, so few years ago, one
saw his father, Lord Kilmarnock, condemned to the
block.’ In 1746, Lord Errol, then Lord Boyd, had
fought at Culloden, against his father.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>AT THE BANQUET.</i></div>

<p>They who were still of that father’s way of thinking
were for long afterwards comforted by a story that
when the King’s Champion proclaimed George <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>
king, and challenged all who questioned the right of
him so proclaimed, by throwing down his glove, a
Champion of James <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> boldly stept forward, took up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
the glove, and retired with it unmolested. The story,
so to speak, got crystalised. It is still partially believed
in. It may have arisen out of an incident chronicled
in ‘Burke’s Peerage.’ It is there said that, officiating at
the coronation as Constable of Scotland, Lord Errol, by
accident, neglected to doff his cap when the king entered;
but on his respectfully apologising for his negligence, his
majesty entreated him to be covered, for he looked on
his presence at the ceremony as a very particular
honour.’ This wears an air of absurdity. However
that may be, Scott has made use of the alleged challenge
of the king’s right to his crown.</p>

<p>It occurs in ‘Redgauntlet,’ where Lilias swiftly
passes through the covering lines of Jacobites, takes up
the gauntlet, and leaves a pledge of battle in its stead.
But contemporary accounts take no note of any such
occurrence. Walpole, an eye-witness, merely records:
‘The Champion acted his part admirably, and dashed
down his gauntlet with proud defiance. His associates,
Lord Talbot, Lord Effingham, and the Duke of Bedford
were woful. Lord Talbot [the Lord High Steward]
piqued himself on backing his horse down the hall
and not turning its rump towards the king; but he had
taken such pains to address it to that duty, that it
entered backwards; and, at his retreat, the spectators
clapped, a terrible indecorum.’ This indecorous clapping,
as the Champion (Dymoke) and his knights
backed out of the hall may have been taken by those
who were not aware of the cause as some party expression.
<span class="sni"><i>GEORGE AND CHARLES EDWARD.</i></span>
Out of it the story of the Jacobite taker-up of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
the glove may have arisen. The story was told with a
difference. A friend (who is anonymous) informed the
Earl Marischal that he had recognised Charles Edward
among the spectators at the coronation banquet, and
had spoken to him. The prince is said to have replied:
‘I came only out of curiosity; and the person who is
the object of all this magnificence is the one I envy the
least.’ Scott, in a note to the incident in ‘Redgauntlet,’
remarks,—‘The story is probably one of the numerous
fictions that were circulated to keep up the spirits of a
sinking faction. The incident was, however, possible,
if it could be supposed to be attended by any motive
adequate to the risk.... George <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>, it is said, had a
police of his own, whose agency was so efficient that the
Sovereign was able to tell his Prime Minister, on one
occasion, to his great surprize, that the Pretender was
in London. The Prime Minister began immediately to
talk of measures to be taken, warrants to be procured,
messengers and guards to be got in readiness. “Pooh!
pooh!” said the good-natured Sovereign, “since I
have found him out, leave me alone to deal with him.”
“And what,” said the Minister, “is your Majesty’s
purpose in so serious a case?” “To leave the young
man to himself,” said George <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>, “and when he tires,
he will go back again.” The truth of this story does
not depend on that of the lifting of the gauntlet, and
while the latter could be but an idle bravado, the
former expresses George <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>’s goodness of heart and
soundness of policy.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><span class="smaller">A DISQUALIFICATION.</span></i></div>

<p>Altogether it is very clear that dates, persons, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
places have been inextricably mixed up in the Jacobite
legends of the Chevalier’s visit to London. At the
same time there seems to be but one opinion among all
writers, without exception, who have dealt with this
subject hitherto, namely, that the alleged visit of 1750
actually occurred. Perhaps the best evidence is furnished
in the ‘Diary of a Lady of Quality’ (Mrs.
Wynne). The writer’s grandson states that his grandmother
had frequently told him that she had had, from
Lady Primrose herself, full particulars of the visit of
Charles Edward to London in 1750. A few questions,
however, might easily break down even this assertion.
After all, the decision must be left to the reader’s judgment.</p>

<p>Although no overt act answered the Champion’s
challenge in Westminster Hall, the right of George <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>
to succeed to the crown was vigorously denied in very
High Church coteries. Soon after the king’s birth, in
1738, he was baptised by Secker, Bishop of Oxford.
Now, Secker was born and bred a dissenter, and did
not enter the Church till after he had been a medical
student, and had run a not too exemplary career.
How could an unbaptised bishop validly baptise a
prince, heir to the crown of England? If the king
was an unbaptised, or as good as unbaptised king, he
was neither lawful King of England nor temporal
head of England’s Church! This was the only form in
which the Champion’s gage was picked up. It did
not amount to much. Nevertheless, an old inheritor
of Nonjuring principles occasionally may be found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
questioning the right of George <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> to succeed, on the
score of his being unbaptised, or of being (still worse)
baptised by an ex-dissenter, who himself had never
been sanctified by the rite according to the Church of
England!
<span class="sni"><i>THE PROTESTANTISM OF CHARLES EDWARD.</i></span>
As to the story of the alleged Protestantism
of Charles Edward, it never had more foundation
than his own ignoble assurances to members of the
Church of England whom he happened to encounter.
In this sense he often ‘<em>declared</em>’ himself; but, never
in a church, at Liége or in Switzerland, or in London,
at St. Martin’s, St. James’s, or St. Mary’s le Strand.
There is no record of any such solemn circumstance
connected with any such exalted personage in any of
those places or edifices. Such a fact as his conversion
would have been utter ruin to him. The very report
that the fact existed caused many of his Irish friends
to tighten their purse-strings. Rome, with full knowledge
that he really had no ‘religion’ at all, was perfectly
satisfied that his Catholicism was uncontaminated.
When, after his father’s death in 1766, Charles Edward
returned to Rome, no recantation, nor anything like it,
was demanded of him.</p>

<p>The stories of the change of religion not only differ
from one another, but the same spreader of the story
gives different versions. Walpole, in his Letters (April
21, 1772) says: ‘I have heard from one who should
know, General Redmond, an Irish officer in the French
service, that the Pretender himself abjured the Roman
Catholic religion at Liége <em>a few years ago</em>.’ Walpole,
in his ‘Last Journals,’ i. 81 (April, 1772), says, ‘General<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
Redmond, a brave old Irish officer in the French service,
and a Roman Catholic, told Lord Holland that
the Pretender had abjured the Roman religion at
Liége, and that the Irish Catholics had withdrawn their
contributions on that account.’ The time is also set
down as ‘<em>a few years ago</em>.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>FOUNDATION OF THE STORY.</i></div>

<p>The entire flimsy fabric of these stories of conversion
was probably raised on a simple but interesting
incident. An English baronet of an ancient family,
Sir Nathaniel Thorold, died at Naples. His heir, a
Roman Catholic, could not succeed. Inheritance was
barred by his being of the Romish Church. The law
was as cruel as anything devised by the ‘Papists,’ on
whose overthrow this legislation was made against
them. To evade it, and secure his rights, the heir of
Sir Nathaniel Thorold, probably, <i lang="la">permissu superiorum</i>,
stripped himself of his Romanism, and became a member
of the Protestant community, at St. Martin’s. This
step entitled him to his uncle’s estates, and, doubtless,
little disturbed his earlier convictions; but is not this
the seed out of which grew the legend of the Pretender’s
cutting himself loose from Popery? Charles Edward, in
some things, was not unlike the craft commanded by poor
Nanty Ewart, which ran in to Annan, with her smuggled
kegs of Cognac, as the ‘Jumping Jenny,’ but
which began her voyage from Dunkirk with seminary
priests on board, as well as brandy, and was there
known as ‘La Sainte Geneviève.’</p>

<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER <abbr title="Fifteen">XV.</abbr></h2>
<h3>(1761-1775.)</h3>
</div>


<div class="sidenote"><i>STATE OF LONDON.</i></div>

<p class="drop-img unindent"><span class="drop-img"><img alt="l" src="images/drop_l.jpg" width="75"></span>
<span class="smcap">ondon</span>, at the beginning of the reign of
George <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>, was, as it had been for many
years, in a condition resembling the
capital of Dahomey at the present time.
It could not be entered by any suburb, including the
Thames, without the nose and eyes being afflicted by
the numerous rottening bodies of criminals gibbeted
in chains. The heads of two rebels still looked
ghastly from Temple Bar. The bodies on gibbets often
created a pestilence. The inhabitants of the infected
districts earnestly petitioned to be relieved from the
horrible oppression. If their petition was unheeded
they took means to relieve themselves. A most significant
paragraph in the papers states that ‘<em>All</em> the
gibbets in the Edgware Road were sawn down in one
night.’ Not only the suburban roads, but the streets
and squares were infested by highwaymen and footpads.
Robberies (with violence) were not only
committed by night, but by day. Murders were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
perpetrated out of mere wantonness, and a monthly
score of delinquents, of extremely wide apart offences,
were strangled at Tyburn, without improvement to
society. It was still a delight to the mob to kill some
very filthy offender in the pillory, who generally was
not more unclean than his assassins. Ladies going to
or from Court in their chairs were often robbed of
their diamonds, the chairmen feigning a defence which
helped the robbers. A prince or princess returning to
London from Hampton Court would now and then
pick up a half-murdered wretch in a ditch, and drop
him at the first apothecary’s in town. The brutal
school boys of St. Bride’s, imitating their fathers, took
to violence as a pastime. They could sweep into Fleet
Street with clubs, knock down all whom they could reach,
and retreat all the prouder if they left a dead victim
on the field. There was anarchy in the streets and
highways, but it is a comfort to find that at the
Chapel Royal, there were none but ‘extreme polite
audiences.’ Indeed, the sons of violence themselves
were not without politeness. A batch of one hundred
of those of whom the gallows had been disappointed,
were marched from Newgate to the river side, to
embark for the Plantations. A fife band preceded
them, playing ‘Through the wood, laddie!’ The
convicts roared out the song. ‘You are very joyous?’
said a spectator. ‘Joyous!’ cried one of the rascals,
‘you only come with us and you’ll find yourself
<em>transported</em>!’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>GOOD FEELING.</i></div>

<p>There were no Jacobites at Oxford now, but there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
was a new sect of Methodists there. Six of its members,
students of Edmund Hall, were expelled for praying
and expounding the Scripture in their own rooms!
In another direction there was something like reconciliation.
The Government at St. James’s allowed a
Popish prelate to establish himself in Canada, on
condition that France should entirely abandon the
Jacobites; and now, for the first time, the king and
royal family of the House of Hanover were prayed
for in all the Roman Catholic chapels in Ireland, and
in the Ambassadors’ chapels in London.</p>

<p>The king showed his respect for the principle of
fidelity, on the part of the Jacobite leaders, by restoring
some of the forfeited estates to the chiefs. He showed
it also in another way. Having been told of a gentleman
of family and fortune in Perthshire, who had not
only refused to take the oath of allegiance to him, but
had never permitted him to be named as king in his
presence, ‘Carry my compliments to him,’ said the
king, ‘but what?—stop!—no!—he may perhaps not
receive my compliment as King of England; give him
the Elector of Hanover’s compliments, and tell him
that he respects the steadiness of his principles.’
Hogg, who tells this story in the introduction to the
‘Jacobite Relics,’ does not see that in this message
there was an excess of condescension that hardly
became the king, though the spirit of the message <em>did</em>.
The story is told with some difference in the introduction
to ‘Redgauntlet.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A JACOBITE FUNERAL.</i></div>

<p>In October of the year 1761, there died a Jacobite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
of some distinction, who had the honour to be permitted
to lie in Westminster Abbey; but, the spectators who
had been at the lying in state, observed, with some
surprise, that his coffin-plate bore only the initials
K. M. L. F. The ‘Funeral Book’ of the Abbey is not
more communicative, save that the age of the defunct
was forty-three. As the coffin sank to its resting
place in the South Aisle, curious strangers were told
that it contained the body of Kenneth Mackenzie,
Lord Fortrose—a dignity not sanctioned by the law;
for, Kenneth was the only son of the fifth Earl of
Seaforth, who suffered attainder and forfeiture for the
part he played in the insurrection of 1715. But
Kenneth left an only son, Kenneth (by Lady Mary
Stewart, daughter of the Earl of Galloway). This son
was not restored to his grandfather’s titles in the Scotch
peerage, but he was created Viscount Fortrose and
Earl of Seaforth in the peerage of Ireland. This
transplantation was not fortunate. Lord Seaforth died,
leaving no male heir, in 1781, when the old Jacobite
title became extinct. The son of the attainted earl,
restored as to his fortune, was in the army, and in
Parliament in 1746, when he accompanied the Duke
of Cumberland to Scotland, but his wife and clan, as
Walpole remarks, went with the Rebels. The Irish
peer but Scotch Earl of Seaforth well deserved his
distinction, when in 1779, with seven hundred Mackenzies
at his back, he repelled the invasion of Jersey
by a French force.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>DR. JOHNSON’S PENSION.</i></div>

<p>Other Jacobites were taken into favour, for which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
loyal service was rendered. One of the first gracious
acts of George <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> was to confer a pension on Dr.
Johnson, of 300<abbr title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr> a year, equal now to twice that sum.
Johnson had well earned it, and he was expressly told
that it was conferred on him for what he had done,
not for anything he was expected to do. He felt that
he was not expected to be an apologist of the Stuarts,
and the first act of the ex-Jacobite, after becoming a
pensioner, was to write for the Rev. Dr. Kennedy’s
‘Complete System of Astronomical Chronology, unfolding
the Scriptures,’ a dedication to the king who
had pensioned him (and whom he had looked upon as the
successor of two usurpers), which dedication is truly
described as being in a strain of very courtly elegance.
As to the granting of the pension by the king, Dr.
Johnson, the once adherent to the Stuart, remarked,
‘The English language does not afford me terms
adequate to my feelings on this occasion. I must have
recourse to the French. I am <i lang="fr">pénétré</i> with his Majesty’s
goodness.’ Johnson was quite sensible that it would be
right to do something more for his reward. The something
was done in another dedication to the Queen, of
Hoole’s translation of Tasso, ‘which is so happily
conceived,’ says Boswell, ‘and elegantly expressed,
that I cannot but point it out to the peculiar notice of
my readers.’ Johnson soon became a partisan of the
Hanoverian family. Speaking of some one who with
more than ordinary boldness attacked public measures
and the royal family, he said, ‘I think he is safe from
the law, but he is an abusive scoundrel; and instead<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
of applying to my Lord Chief Justice to punish him,
I would send half-a-dozen footmen and have him
well ducked.’ A semi-noyade was now thought fitting
recompense for a Stuart apologist.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>JOHNSON’S VIEW OF IT.</i></div>

<p>At a later period, when Johnson reviewed, in
‘The Gentleman’s Magazine,’ Tyler’s Vindication of
Mary Queen of Scots, the Jacobitism quite as much as
the generosity of his principles led him to say, ‘It has
now been fashionable for near half a century to defame
and vilify the House of Stuart.... The Stuarts
have found few apologists, for the dead cannot pay
for praise, and who will without reward oppose the
tide of popularity?’</p>

<p>Johnson being accused of tergiversation, has a
right to be heard in his own case. Much censured
for accepting a pension which many a censurer would
have taken with the utmost alacrity, ‘Why, Sir,’ said
he with a hearty laugh, ‘it is a mighty foolish noise
that they make. I have accepted a pension as a
reward which has been thought due to my literary
merit; and now that I have the pension, I am the
same man in every respect that I have ever been. I
retain the same principles. It is true that I cannot
now curse (smiling) the House of Hanover, nor would
it be decent of me to drink King James’s health in the
wine that King George gives me money to pay for.
But, Sir, I think that the pleasure of cursing the House
of Hanover and drinking King James’s health, are
amply overbalanced by 300<abbr title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr> a year.’ To this may
be added Boswell’s assurance that Johnson had little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
confidence in the rights claimed by the Stuarts, and
that he felt, in course of time, much abatement of his
own Toryism.
<span class="sni"><i>HIS DEFINITION OF A JACOBITE.</i></span>
It was in his early days that he talked
<em>fierce</em> Jacobitism, at Mr. Langton’s, to that gentleman’s
niece, Miss Roberts. The Bishop of Salisbury (Douglas)
and other eminent men were present. Johnson, taking
the young lady by the hand, said, ‘My dear, I hope
you are a Jacobite.’ Her uncle was a Tory without
being a Jacobite, and he angrily asked why Johnson
thus addressed his niece? ‘Why, Sir,’ said Johnson,
‘I meant no offence to your niece, I mean her a great
compliment. A Jacobite, Sir, believes in the Divine
Right of kings. He who believes in the Divine Right of
kings believes in a Divinity. A Jacobite believes in
the Divine Right of bishops. He that believes in the
Divine Right of bishops believes in the Divine Authority
of the Christian Religion. Therefore, Sir, a Jacobite
is neither an Atheist nor a Deist. That cannot be said
of a Whig, for Whiggism is a negation of all principle.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>DEATH OF THE DUKE OF CUMBERLAND.</i></div>

<p>Be this as it may, Jacobitism was as surely dying
out as he was who had crushed the hopes of Jacobites
at Culloden. The victor on that field, and even now
in the prime of life, died in 1765, of what Walpole
called a ‘rot among princes.’ He was a ton of man,
unwieldy, asthmatic, blind of one eye, nearly so of the
other, lame through his old Dettingen wound, half
breathless from asthma, half paralysed by an old attack,
able to write a letter, yet not able to collect his senses
sufficiently to play a game of piquet. On the 30th
of October, he went to Court, and received Lord<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
Albemarle to dine with him, at his house in Grosvenor
Street. Unable to attend a Cabinet Council in the
evening, the Duke of Newcastle and Lord Northington
called on him. As they entered the room, one of his
valets was about to bleed him, at his own request.
Before the operation could be performed, the duke
murmured, ‘It is all over!’ and fell dead in Lord
Albemarle’s arms.</p>

<p>Lord Albemarle remembered that when the duke’s
brother, Frederick, Prince of Wales, died, his cautious
widow immediately burned all his papers and letters.
Lord Albemarle could not take upon himself to destroy
the duke’s papers, but he sent the whole of them to
the duke’s favourite sister, the Princess Amelia. She
replied, from Gunnersbury, ‘You are always attentive
and obliging, my good Lord Albemarle. I thank you
for the letters, and I have burnt them.’ Many a secret
perished with them. George <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> conferred on Lord
Albemarle the duke’s garter.</p>

<p>The bitterness and pertinacity of the Jacobites
against the duke cannot be better illustrated than by
an incident recorded by Boswell. Johnson, Wedderburne,
Murphy, and Foote, visited ‘Bedlam’ (in Moorfields)
together. At that time idle people went to look
at the ‘mad people in dens,’ as they now go to a
menagerie, or ‘the Zoo.’ Boswell says that Foote
gave a very entertaining account of Johnson having his
attention arrested by a man who was very furious, and
who, while beating his straw, supposed it was William
Duke of Cumberland, whom he was punishing for his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
cruelties in Scotland, in 1746. The entertainment was
in the fact that Jacobite Johnson was amused by this
sad spectacle.</p>

<p>The duke was soon followed on ‘the way to dusty
death,’ by him whose life he had certainly helped to
embitter.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>DEATH OF THE OLD CHEVALIER.</i></div>

<p>The death of the Chevalier de St. George, at Rome, on
New Year’s Night, 1766, was not known in London for
nearly a fortnight. The only stir caused by it was at
the Council Board at St. James’s, whence couriers
rode away with despatches for foreign courts, which
couriers speedily returned with satisfactory answers.
The Chevalier might, like Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>, have apologised
to those who attended his death-bed, on his being so
long adying. What had come to be thought of him in
London may be partly seen in Walpole’s ‘Memoirs of
the reign of George <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>’ There the Chevalier is
spoken of as one who had outlived his own hopes and
the people who had ever given him any. ‘His party
was dwindled to scarce any but Catholics.’ Of the
church of the latter, Walpole calls him the most
meritorious martyr, and yet Rome would not recognise
the royalty of the heirs. ‘To such complete humiliation
was reduced that ever unfortunate House of
Stuart, now at last denied the empty sound of royalty
by the Church and Court, for which they had sacrificed
three kingdoms.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>FUNERAL RITES.</i></div>

<p>The newspapers and other periodicals of the time
took less interest in the event than in a prize-fight.
The feeling with trifling exception was one of indifference,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
but there was nowhere any expression of disrespect.
The various accounts of the imperial ceremony
with which the body of the unlucky prince lay in state,
and was ultimately entombed, were no doubt read with
avidity. The imagination of successive reporters grew
with details of their subject. A figure of Death which
appears among the ‘properties’ of the lying in state, in
the earliest account, expands into ‘thirteen skeletons
holding wax tapers’ in the later communications. To
this state ceremony, the London papers assert, none
were admitted but Italian princes and English—Jacobites
of course,—several of whom left London for the purpose.
At the transfer of the body to St. Peter’s, the royal
corpse was surrounded by ‘the English college,’ and
was followed by ‘four Cardinals on mules covered with
purple velvet hangings.’ The Jacobites must have put
down the London papers with a feeling that their king
was dead, and a hope that his soul was at rest.</p>

<p>The death seems to have had a curious effect on
at least one London Jacobite. In January, 1766, two
heads remained on Temple Bar. The individual just
referred to thought they had remained there long enough.
For some nights he secretly discharged bullets at them
from a cross-bow; and at last he was caught in the
act. He was suspected of being a kinsman of one of the
unhappy sufferers; but in presence of the magistrates he
maintained that he was a loyal friend of the established
government; ‘that he thought it was not sufficient that
traitors should merely suffer death, and that consequently
he had treated the heads with indignity by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
trying to smash them.’ This offender, who affected a
sort of silliness, was dismissed with a caution. There
were found upon him fifty musket bullets, separately
wrapped in paper, each envelope bearing the motto
‘Eripuit ille vitam,’ the application of which would
have puzzled Œdipus himself.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>GEORGE <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> AND DR. JOHNSON.</i></div>

<p>The next incident of the time connected with
Jacobitism is the celebrated interview between the
king and Dr. Johnson. In that celebrated audience
which the old Tory had of the king, in February, 1767,
in the library of Buckingham Palace, sovereign and
subject acquitted themselves equally well. Mr. Barnard,
the librarian, had settled Johnson, and left him, by the
library fireside. The Doctor was deep in a volume
when the king and Barnard entered quietly by a
private door, and the librarian, going up to Johnson,
whispered in his ear, ‘Sir, here is the king.’ George
<abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> was ‘courteously easy.’ Johnson was self-possessed
and equally at his ease, as he stood in the king’s
presence.</p>

<p>With little exception, the conversation was purely
literary: the characteristics of the Oxford and Cambridge
libraries; the publications of the University
presses; the labours of Johnson himself; the controversy
between Warburton and Lowth; Lord Lyttelton
as a historian; the merits of the universal Dr. Hill;
the quality of home and foreign periodicals; and so on.
When Lyttelton was named, Johnson said he had
blamed Henry <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> over much. The king thought historians
seldom did such things by halves. ‘No, Sir,’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
said Johnson, ‘not to kings;’ but he added: ‘That for
those who spoke worse of kings than they deserved,
he could find no excuse; but he could more easily
conceive how some might speak better of them than
they deserved, without any ill intention; for as kings
had much in their power to give, those who were
favoured by them would frequently, from gratitude,
exaggerate their praises; and as this proceeded from a
good motive, it was certainly excusable—as far as error
was excusable.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>JOHNSON, ON GEORGE <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr></i></div>

<p>When Johnson submitted that he himself had done
his part as a writer, ‘I should have thought so, too,’
said the king, ‘if you had not written so well.’
Johnson spoke of this to Boswell in these words:
‘No man could have paid a handsomer compliment,
and it was fit for a king to pay: it was decisive.’ On
another occasion, Johnson being asked if he made any
reply to this high compliment, he answered: ‘No, Sir.
When the king had said it, it was to be so. It was not
for me to bandy civilities with my sovereign.’ Later
still he said, ‘I find it does a man good to be talked to
by his sovereign;’ and for some time subsequently he
continued to speak of the king as he had spoken of
him to Mr. Barnard, after the interview: ‘Sir, they
may talk of the king as they will, but he is the finest
gentleman I have ever seen;’ and later, ‘still harping
on my daughter,’ he said at Langton’s: ‘Sir, his manners
are those of as fine a gentleman as we may suppose
Louis <abbr title="Fourteen">XIV.</abbr> or Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>’</p>

<p>Assuredly, the fine-gentleman manners of either<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
king were not now to be found in the Charles Edward
who aspired to the throne which Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> had occupied.
A passage in an autograph letter, addressed in
May, 1767, by Cardinal York to a friend of the family in
London (where it was offered for sale three or four
years ago), shows the condition of the prince, and
shadows forth the lingering hopes of the family. The
Cardinal, after stating that the Pope had presented
Charles Edward with ‘a pair of beads,’ adds: ‘They
are of such a kind as are <em>only given to Sovrains</em>, and
could wee but gett the better of the nasty Bottle,
which every now and then comes on by spurts, I would
hope a greet deal of ouer gaining a good deal <em>as to
other things</em>.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>JOHNSON’S PENSION OPPOSED.</i></div>

<p>Four years later (that is, in 1771), the pensioning of
Jacobite Johnson was brought before the notice of the
House of Commons. In parliament, his Jacobitism was
made use of as a weapon against himself. Townshend’s
charge against the Ministry was based on the alleged
fact that Johnson was a pensioner, and was expected to
earn his pension. ‘I consider him,’ said Townshend,
‘a man of some talent, but no temper. The principle
he upholds I shall ever detest. This man, a Jacobite
by principle, has been encouraged, fostered, pensioned,
because he <em>is</em> a Jacobite.’ Wedderburn denied it, and
aptly asked, ‘If a papist, or a theoretical admirer of
a republican form of government, should be a great
mathematician or a great poet, doing honour to his
country and his age, and should fall into destitution, is
he to be excluded from the royal bounty?’ The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
answer is patent; but it is not a matter for gratulation
that Johnson wrote, as Lord Campbell remarks, ‘out
of gratitude, “The False Alarm,” and “Taxation no
Tyranny,” the proof sheets of which were revised at
the Treasury.’ Johnson himself did not prove that his
withers were unwrung by the vaunting remark to
Davies: ‘I wish my pension, Sir, were twice as large,
that they might make twice as much noise.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A 30TH OF JANUARY SERMON.</i></div>

<p>In 1772, Jacobitism was again under parliamentary
notice. At this time, although the Nonjurors kept true
in their allegiance to the hereditary right of the Stuarts,
the Tories were as opposite as could be to those of the
old turbulent era of ‘High Church and Ormond!’
On the 30th of January, Dr. Nowell (Principal of St.
Mary, Oxford) preached before the House of Commons
a sermon that Sacheverel might have preached. That
is to say, he vindicated Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>; he also drew a
parallel between him and George <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>, and indulged in
very high Tory sentiments. As usual, the preacher
was thanked, and he was requested to print his discourse,
which was done accordingly. At this juncture
the younger Townshend moved in the House to have
the sermon burnt by the common hangman; but, says
Walpole (in his ‘Last Journals’), ‘as the Houses had,
according to custom, thanked the parson for his sermon,
without hearing or reading it, they could not censure
it now without exposing themselves to great ridicule.’
They did censure it, nevertheless.
<span class="sni"><i>DEBATE ON THE SERMON.</i></span>
Captain Walsingham
Boyle, R.N., proposed, and Major-General Irwin
seconded, the motion that the vote of thanks should be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
expunged. This was opposed by Sir William Dolben
and Sir Roger Newdegate, who had proposed the vote
of thanks. ‘Sir Roger,’ says Walpole, as above,
‘was stupidly hot, and spoke with all the flame of
stupid bigotry, declaring that he would maintain all
the doctrines in the sermon were constitutional.’
T. Townshend, <abbr title="junior">jun.</abbr>, showed how repugnant they were
to the constitution, and it was carried by 152 to 41, to
expunge the thanks. General Keppel, Colonel Fitzroy
(Vice-Chamberlain to the king), and Charles Fox, all
descendants of Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>, voted against the sermon, as
did even Dyson and many courtiers. The 41 were
rank Tories, all but Rigby, who had retired behind the
chair; but, being made to vote, voted as he thought
the king would like, to whom he paid the greatest
court, expecting to be Chancellor of the Exchequer if
Lord Guilford should die and Lord North go into the
House of Lords. This proper severity on the sermon,’
as Walpole now calls it, ‘was a great blow to the
Court, as clergymen would fear to be too forward with
their servility, when the censure of Parliament might
make it unadvisable for the king to prefer them.’
Boswell thought that ‘Dr. Nowell will ever have the
honour which is due to a lofty friend of our monarchical
constitution.’ ‘Sir,’ said Johnson, ‘the Court
will be very much to blame if he is not promoted.’ A
dozen years later, Johnson, Boswell, and ‘very agreeable
company at Dr. Nowell’s, drank Church and King after
dinner with true Tory cordiality.’ The toast had a
different personal application in former days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>MARRIAGE OF CHARLES EDWARD.</i></div>

<p>And there was something a-foot which might
culminate in restoring that old personal application.
London suddenly heard that Charles Edward had
quite as suddenly disappeared from Florence. ‘I am
sorry,’ Walpole wrote to our minister at Florence, in
September, ‘that so watchful a cat should let its mouse
slip at last, without knowing into what hole it is run.’
Walpole conjectured Spain, on his way to Ireland, with
Spanish help. But the prince was bent on other things,
and not on invasion and conquest by force of arms.
Charles Edward had once declared (London gossip at
least gave him the credit of the declaration) that he
would never marry, in order that England might not
be trammeled by new complications. When he <em>did</em>
marry, the London papers made less ado about it than
if the son of an alderman had married ‘an agreeable
and pretty young lady with a considerable fortune.’
This single paragraph told the Londoners of the
princely match: ‘April 1st, 1772. The Pretender
was married the 28th of last month at St. Germain,
in France, by proxy, to a Princess of Stolberg, who set
off immediately to Italy to meet him.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>WALPOLE, ON THE MARRIAGE.</i></div>

<p>Walpole reflects, but exaggerates, the opinions of
London fashionable society, on the marriage of Charles
Edward. He knows little about the bride. ‘The new
Pretendress is said to be but sixteen, and a Lutheran.
I doubt the latter. If the former is true, I suppose
they mean to carry on the breed in the way it began—by
a spurious child. A Fitz-Pretender is an excellent
continuation of the patriarchal line.’ At that time the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
Royal Marriage Bill, which prohibited the princes
and princesses of the Royal Family from marrying
without the consent of the Sovereign, or, in certain
cases, of Parliament, was being much discussed.
‘Thereupon,’ Mr. Chute says, ‘when the Royal Family
are prevented from marrying, it is a right time for
the Stuarts to marry. This event seems to explain the
Pretender’s disappearance last autumn; and though
they sent him back from Paris, they may not dislike
the propagation of thorns in our side.’</p>

<p>In a subsequent letter, Walpole continues the subject.
‘I do not believe,’ he says, ‘that she is a Protestant,
though I have heard from one who should
know, General Redmond, an Irish officer in the French
service, that the Pretender himself abjured the Roman
Catholic religion at Liége, a few years ago, and that,
on that account, the Irish Catholics no longer make
him remittances. This would be some, and the only
apology, but fear, for the Pope’s refusing him the title
of king. What say you to this Protestantism? At
Paris they call his income twenty-five thousand pound
sterling a year. His bride has nothing but many
quarters. The Cardinal of York’s answer last year to
the question of <em>whither his brother was gone</em>? is now
explained. “You told me,” he replied, “<em>whither</em> he
should have gone a year sooner.”’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE LAST HEADS ON TEMPLE BAR.</i></div>

<p>The London papers of the 1st of April contained
other information not uninteresting to Jacobites. It
was in this form:—‘Yesterday, one of the rebel heads
on Temple Bar fell down. There is only one head now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
remaining.’ The remaining head fell shortly after.
They were popularly said to be those of Towneley and
Fletcher; and, as before noticed, there is a legend that
Towneley’s head is still preserved in London. The
late Mr. Timbs, in his ‘London and Westminster,’ gives
this account of ‘the rebel heads’ and their farewell to
the Bar:—‘Mrs. Black, the wife of the editor of the
‘Morning Chronicle,’ when asked if she remembered
any heads on Temple Bar, used to reply in her brusque,
hearty way: “Boys, I recollect the scene well. I have
seen on that Temple Bar, about which you ask, two
human heads—real heads—traitors’ heads—spiked on
iron poles. There were two. I saw one fall (March
31st, 1772). Women shrieked as it fell; men, as I have
heard, shrieked. One woman near me fainted. Yes,
boys, I recollect seeing human heads on Temple
Bar.”’ The spikes were not removed till early in the
present century.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>DALRYMPLE’S ‘MEMOIRS.’</i></div>

<p>At this period merit in literature was allowed or
denied, according to the writer’s politics. In 1773
Sir John Dalrymple published the famous second
volume of his ‘Memoirs of Great Britain and Ireland,
from the dissolution of the last Parliament until the
Sea-Battle of La Hogue.’ The first volume had appeared
two years previously. The third and concluding
volume was not published till 1788. The
second volume was <em>famous</em> for its exposure of Lord
William Russell and Algernon Sidney as recipients
of money from <a id="chg6"></a>Louis <abbr title="Fourteen">XIV.</abbr>; money not personally
applied, but used, or supposed to be used, for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
purpose of establishing a republic. Walpole was
furious at a book which, while it treated both sides,
generally, with little tenderness, absolved the last two
Stuart kings from blame, and spoke of William with
particular severity. Walpole says of Sir John: ‘He
had been a hearty Jacobite; pretended to be converted;
then paid his court when he found his old
principles were no longer a disrecommendation at
court. The great object of his work was to depreciate
and calumniate all the friends of the Revolution.... The
famous second volume was a direct charge of bribery
from France, on the venerable hero, Algernon Sidney,
pretended to be drawn from Barillon’s papers at Versailles,
a source shut up to others, and actually opened
to Sir John, by the intercession of even George <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>—a
charge I would not make but on the best authority.
Lord Nuneham, son of Lord Harcourt, then ambassador
in Paris, told me his father obtained licence for
Sir John to search those archives—amazing proof of
all I have said on the designs of this reign; what must
they be when George <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> encourages a Jacobite wretch
to hunt in France for materials for blackening the
heroes who withstood the enemies of Protestants and
Liberty?... Men saw the Court could have no meaning
but to sap all virtuous principles and to level the best
men to the worst,—a plot more base and destructive
than any harboured by the Stuarts.... Who could
trust to evidence either furnished from Versailles or
coined as if it came from thence? And who could trust
to Sir John, who was accused, I know not how truly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
of having attempted to get his own father hanged, and
who had been turned out of a place, by Lord Rockingham,
for having accepted a bribe?’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>WALPOLE’S ANTI-JACOBITISM.</i></div>

<p>The above, from Walpole’s ‘Last Journals,’ is a
curious burst of Anti-Jacobitism, on the part of a man
who gave Sir John Dalrymple a letter of introduction
to the French Minister, de Choiseul! Sir John in his
preface names ‘Mr. Stanley, Lord Harcourt, and Mr.
Walpole,’ as furnishing him with such introductions.
All that the king did was to allow access to William <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>’s
private chest, at Kensington, and the ‘ex-Jacobite
wretch’ to make what he could out of the contents.
Walpole never forgave him. In 1774, when a Bill,
to relieve booksellers who had bought property in
copies, was before the Commons, ‘the impudent Sir
John Dalrymple,’ as Walpole calls him, ‘pleaded at the
bar of the House against the booksellers, who had paid
him 2000<abbr title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr> for his book in support of the Stuarts.
This was the wretch,’ cries Walpole, ‘who had traduced
Virtue and Algernon Sidney!’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ANTI-ULTRAMONTANISM.</i></div>

<p>Walpole spared Lord Mansfield, the brother of
Murray of Broughton (and almost as much of a Jacobite),
as little as he did Dalrymple. In June, this year, there
was a hotly-sustained battle in the Commons over the
Quebec Bill. The Bill was denounced as an attempt
to involve Protestants under a Roman Catholic jurisdiction.
The Court was accused of preparing a Popish
army to keep down the American colonies. Walpole
charged Lord Mansfield with being the author of the
Bill, and with disavowing the authorship. On the 9th<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
of June, Lord North proposed to adjourn the debate
till the 11th, as on the intervening day Lord Stanley
was to give a grand entertainment at the Oaks, near
Epsom, in honour of his intended bride, Lady Betty
Hamilton. The opposition in the House did not let
slip the palpable opportunity. They severely ridiculed
the minister, and Tom Townshend told him,—the
Pretender’s birthday, the 10th of June, was a proper
festival for finishing a Bill of so Stuart-like a complexion!
Camden said, in the Lords, that the king,
by favouring such a measure, would commit a breach
of his coronation oath. Walpole has recorded, in his
‘Last Journals,’ that the sovereign who was wearing
the crown of England, to the prejudice of the Stuart
family, was doing by the authority of a free parliament
what James <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> was expelled for doing. The City told
the king, in a petition not to pass the Bill, that he had
no right to the crown but as a protector of the Protestant
religion. Walpole remarked, ‘The King has a
Scotch Chief Justice, abler than Laud, though not so
intrepid as Lord Strafford. Laud and Strafford lost
their heads,—Lord Mansfield would not lose his, for
he would die of fear, if he were in danger, of which,
unfortunately, there is no prospect.’ The Bill was
carried in both Houses. On the 22nd of June, the
king went down to the Lords to pass the Bill, and prorogue
the Parliament. The crowded streets wore quite
the air of old Jacobite times. The feeling of dread
and hatred, not against English Catholics, but against
that form of Popery called Ultramontanism, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
would, if it could, dash out the brains of Protestantism,
and overthrow kings and thrones ‘ad majorem Dei
gloriam,’ found bitter expression on that day. ‘His
Majesty,’ according to the journals, ‘was much insulted
on his way to the House of Peers yesterday. The cry
of <span class="smcap">No Popery!</span> was re-echoed from every quarter, and
the noisy expressions of displeasure were greater than
his Majesty ever yet heard.’ On the other hand, the
king’s brother, the Duke of Gloucester, rose suddenly
into favour. He voted against the Bill. With reference
to that step, the ‘Public Advertiser’ chronicled
the following lines: ‘’Tis said that a great personage
has taken an additional disgust at another great personage
dividing with the minority on Friday last. This
is the second heinous offence the latter has been guilty
of; the first, committing matrimony; and now, professing
himself a Protestant.’ Walpole thought it was judicious
in him to let it be seen that at least one Prince of the
House of Hanover had the Protestant cause at heart,
and the preservation of the ‘happy establishment.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">‘<i>THE HAPPY ESTABLISHMENT.</i>’</div>

<p>As the study of the times is pursued, the student is
no sooner disposed to believe that Jacobitism has
ultimately evaporated, than he comes upon some
remarkable proof to the contrary. The following is
one of such proofs.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>GARRICK’S MACBETH.</i></div>

<p>In the year 1775, some friend of the drama remonstrated
with Garrick on the absurdity of the costume
in which he and other actors of Macbeth played the
hero of Shakespeare’s tragedy. The actor of the Thane
generally dressed the character in a modern military<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
uniform. As an improvement, it was suggested that a
tartan dress was the proper costume to wear. Of
course the real Macbeth was never seen in such a dress;
but Garrick was not troubled at <em>that</em>. He objected for
another reason. ‘It is only thirty years ago,’ he said,
‘that the Pretender was in England. Party spirit runs
so high that if I were to put on tartan, I should be
hissed off the stage, and perhaps the house would be
pulled down!’ It should be remembered that when
Macklin changed <em>his</em> Macbeth costume from that of
an English general to a plaid coat and trousers, Quin
said that Macklin had turned Macbeth into an old
Scotch piper.</p>

<p>The party spirit to which Garrick alluded seems to
have revived in the person of Dr. Johnson, whose
principles led him still to sympathise with the Jacobite
cause.</p>

<p class="drop-img unindent"><span class="drop-img"><img alt="a" src="images/drop_a.jpg" width="75"></span>
<span class="smcap">very</span> fair instance of Jacobite sentiment in
London, in the year 1777, presents itself
in a record by Boswell, in his ‘Life of Dr.
Johnson.’ The doctor, in argument with
the Whig Dr. Taylor, insisted that the popular inclination
was still for the Stuart family, against that of
Brunswick, and that if England were fairly polled, the
present king would be sent away to-night, and his adherents
hanged to-morrow!’ Taylor demurred, and
Johnson gave this as the ‘state of the country.’—‘The
people, knowing it to be agreed on all hands, that this
king has not the hereditary right to the crown, and
there being no hope that he who has it can be restored,
have grown cold and indifferent upon the subject of
loyalty and have no warm attachment to any king.
They would not, therefore, risk anything to restore the
exiled family. They would not give twenty shillings a
piece to bring it about; but if a mere vote could do it,
there would be twenty to one; at least, there would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>
a very great majority of voices for it. But, Sir, you
are to consider that all those who consider that a king
has a right to his crown, as a man has to his estate,
which is the just opinion, would be for restoring the
king who certainly has the hereditary right, could he
be trusted with it; in which there would be no danger
now, when laws and everything else are so much advanced,
and every king will govern by the laws.’ It
was in the same year, 1777, that Johnson called the
design of the young Chevalier to gain a crown for his
father ‘a noble attempt;’ and Boswell expressed his
wish that ‘we could have an authentic history of it.’
More than a generation had passed away since the
attempt had failed, but Johnson thought the history
might be written: ‘If you were not an idle dog, you
might write it by collecting from everybody what they
can tell, and putting down your authorities.’ It was
shortly after that, hearing of a Mr. Eld, as being a
Whig, in Staffordshire, Johnson remarked, ‘There are
rascals in all counties.’ It was then he made his celebrated
assertion that ‘the first Whig was the Devil;’
but this Jacobite definition was provoked by Eld’s
coarse description of a Tory as ‘a creature generated
between a nonjuring parson and one’s grandmother.’
Lord Marchmont thought Johnson had distinguished
himself by being the first man who had brought ‘Whig’
and ‘Tory’ into a dictionary.</p>

<p>‘Nonjuring parsons’ still existed; but the hierarchy
was all but extinguished.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE LAST OF THE NONJURING BISHOPS.</i></div>

<p>In the last week of November 1779, reverential<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
groups were assembled in Theobald’s Road, to witness
the passing to the grave of the last nonjuring bishop of
the <em>regular</em> succession—Bishop Gordon. There was
no demonstration but of respect. Yet there must have
been some Jacobites of the old leaven among the spectators;
though many Nonjurors were not Jacobites at
all. To this record may be added here the fact that in
St. Giles’s churchyard, Shrewsbury, lie the remains of
another nonjuring bishop, William Cartwright, who is
commonly called ‘the Apothecary,’ because, like other
bishops of the sturdy little community, he practised
medicine. Cartwright (who came of the ‘Separatists,’
a division which started about 1734, with one bishop)
always dressed in prelatic violet cloth. Hoadley once
surprised a party at Shrewsbury by saying, ‘William
Cartwright is as good a bishop as I am.’ Cartwright
hardly thought so himself, for in 1799, in which year
he died, he was reconciled to the established church, at
the Abbey in Shrewsbury, by a clergyman who in his old
age revealed the fact to a writer who made it public in
1874, in the ‘Dictionary of Sects, Heresies, and Schools
of Thought,’ edited by the Rev. John Henry Blunt.
No reason is given why the alleged fact was made a
mystery of for so long a period.</p>

<p>The very last of <em>all</em> the nonjuring bishops, one of the
irregular succession, died in Ireland in 1805, namely,
Boothe. He was irregularly consecrated by Garnet,
who had been consecrated by Cartwright, who had
been consecrated by Deacon. Nonjuring congregations,
in London and elsewhere,—they generally met in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>
private houses,—diminished and dissolved. Here and
there, a family or an individual might be met with who
would use no Prayer Books but those published before
the Revolution of 1688. Probably, the last Nonjuror
(if not the last Jacobite) in England died in the Charter
House, London, in 1875—the late Mr. James Yeowell,
for many years the worthy and well-known sub-editor
of ‘Notes and Queries.’ To him, the true church was
that of Ken, and his true sovereign was to be looked
for in the line of Stuart; but Mr. Yeowell acknowledged
the force of circumstances, and was as honest a
subject of Queen Victoria as that royal lady could
desire to possess.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE JACOBITE MUSE.</i></div>

<p>The Jacobite and Nonjuring pulpits were unoccupied
and silent, but the Muses manifested vitality. The
tenacity, and one might almost say, the audacity of
Jacobite loyalty was well illustrated in 1779 by the
publication of a collection of songs, under the title of
‘The True Loyalist, or Chevalier’s Favourite.’ In one
of the ballads both Flora Macdonald and Charles
Edward are alluded <span class="lock">to:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Over yon hills and yon lofty mountain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Where the trees are clad with snow;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And down by yon murm’ring crystal fountain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Where the silver streams do flow;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There fair Flora sat, complaining</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">For the absence of our King,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Crying, ‘Charlie, lovely Charlie!</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">When shall we two meet again?’</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">At this period, the unhappy Charles Edward was neither
lovely nor loveable. His ballad poet, above, has paraphrased,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>
or parodied, a popular song, ‘Over Hills and
high Mountains,’—but so ill, with excess or lack of feet,
indifferently, as to serve the measure with the arbitrary
despotism with which the Stuarts themselves would
have visited Church and Constitution.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>JACOBITE JOHNSON.</i></div>

<p>It will be remembered that when Jacobite Johnson
was pensioned, the English language did not suffice to
give expression to his feelings. He was obliged to
borrow a word from France: he was <i lang="fr">pénétré</i> with his
Majesty’s goodness. In 1783,—weighing Stuart against
Brunswick, Johnson borrowed a word from the same
foreign source, to disparage the House of Hanover. It
must be confessed that Dr. Johnson’s Jacobitism had
become a ‘sentiment,’ in 1783. He could then indignantly
denounce the factious opposition to Government,
and yet account for it on Jacobite principles.
He imputed it to the Revolution. One night, at Mrs.
Thrale’s house in Argyle Street, where the conversation
turned on this subject, ‘Sir,’ said he, in a low voice,
having come nearer to me, while his old prejudices
seemed to be fermenting in his mind, ‘the Hanoverian
family is <i lang="fr">isolée</i> here. They have no friends. Now,
the Stuarts had friends who stuck by them so late as
1745. When the right of the king is not reverenced,
there will not be reverence for those appointed by the
king.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>BOSWELL, ON ALLEGIANCE.</i></div>

<p>In June of the following year, 1784, Johnson made
a remark which very reasonably struck Boswell ‘a
good deal.’—‘I never,’ said Johnson, ‘knew a Nonjuror
who could reason.’ On which observation and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>
on the position of the Nonjurors and their Jacobite
allegiance, generally, Boswell makes this comment:—‘Surely,
he did not mean to deny that faculty to many
of their writers,—to Hickes, Brett, and other eminent
divines of that persuasion, and did not recollect that
the seven Bishops, so justly celebrated for their magnanimous
resistance to arbitrary power, were yet Nonjurors
to the new Government. The nonjuring clergy
of Scotland, indeed, who, excepting a few, have lately,
by a sudden stroke, cut off all ties of allegiance to the
House of Stuart, and resolved to pray for our present
lawful Sovereign by name, may be thought to have
confirmed this remark; as it may be said that the
divine, indefeasible, hereditary right which they professed
to believe, if ever true, must be equally true
still. Many of my readers will be surprised when I
mention that Johnson assured me he had never in his
life been in a nonjuring meeting-house.’—Johnson’s
disrespect for the reasoning powers of the Nonjurors
was still less intense than his detestation of the Whigs.
Of some eminent man of the party, he allowed the
ability, but he added, ‘Sir, he is a cursed Whig, a
<em>bottomless</em> Whig, as they all are now.’</p>

<p>Walpole was satisfied that the Stuart race was
effete, and that the family was incapable of exciting the
smallest sensation in England. He could not, however,
pass over an incident in ‘the other family.’</p>

<p>In allusion to the Prince of Wales and the Roman
Catholic widow (of two husbands) whom he married,—Mrs.
Fitzherbert, he says: 1786, ‘We have other guess<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
matter to talk of in a higher and more flourishing
race; and yet were rumour;—aye, much more than
rumour, every voice in England—to be credited, the
matter, somehow or other, reaches from London to
Rome.’ Happily, no new ‘Pretender’ arose from this
extraordinary union.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A JACOBITE ACTRESS.</i></div>

<p>In this year, in the month of July, the comedy of
‘The Provoked Husband’ was played at the Haymarket,
‘Lady Townley, by a Lady, her 1st appearance
in London.’ The lady and the incident had some
interest for those who held Jacobite principles. They
knew she was the daughter of an old Scotch Jacobite,
Watson, whose participation in the ’45 had perilled
his life, ruined his fortune, and caused him to fly his
country. He died in Jamaica. His widow returned
to Europe, and brought up the family, creditably. In
course of time; Miss Watson married a paper-manufacturer,
or vendor, named Brooks. His early death
compelled her to go on the stage; her success, fair in
the metropolis, was more brilliant in Dublin, Edinburgh,
and other important cities, especially where
Jacobite sympathy was alive. It is curious that in
Boswell’s account of the tour to the Hebrides with
Johnson, under the date, September 7th, 1773, when
they were at Sir Alexander Macdonald’s, at the farm of
Corrichattachin, in Skye, among the things which he
found in the house was ‘a mezzotinto of Mrs. Brooks,
the actress, by some strange chance in Skye.’ The
portrait, in 1773, was not that of an actress; nor was
the lady then Mrs. Brooks; but that was her name, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span>
such was her profession when Boswell published his
Life of Dr. Johnson, in 1791; at which time, however,
he was not aware of her Jacobite descent. Some
persons, unpleasantly advanced in years, recollect old
Mrs. Brooks’s powerful delineation of Meg Murdockson,
in T. Dibdin’s ‘Heart of Mid Lothian,’ about the year
1820, at the Surrey Theatre, and they suggest that she
was the old Jacobite’s daughter.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>BURNS’S ‘DREAM.’</i></div>

<p>In the year in which the Jacobite’s daughter made
her first appearance in London, as ‘Lady Townley,’
Burns wrote the verses which he called ‘A Dream,’
with this <span class="lock">epigraph:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Thoughts, words, and deeds the Statute blames with reason,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But surely Dreams were ne’er indicted Treason.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">The poet then dreams of being at St. James’s on the
king’s birthday, and addressing George <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> in place of
the Laureate. The feeling expressed was no doubt one
that had come to be universal,—namely, of respect for
a monarch and his family, about whom, however, the
poet could see nothing of that divinity which was supposed
of old to hedge such supreme folk. But Burns
recognised a constitutional king, from whom he turned,
to attack his responsible <span class="lock">ministers:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Far be’t frae me that I aspire</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To blame your legislation,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or say ye wisdom want, or fire,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To rule this mighty nation.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But, faith! I muckle doubt, my Sire,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Ye’ve trusted ’Ministration</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To chaps who, in a barn or byre,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Wad better fill’d their station</div>
    <div class="verse indent14">Than courts, yon day.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span></p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>BURNS ON THE STUARTS.</i></div>

<p>In the following year, Burns still more satisfactorily
illustrated the general feeling as being one of loyalty
to the accomplished fact in the person of the king at
St. James’s, but with no diminution of respect for the
royal race that had lost the inheritance of majesty.
This the Scottish bard expressed in the ‘Poetical
Address’ to Mr. W. Tytler. He lamented indeed that
the name of Stuart was now ‘despised and neglected,’
but, he <span class="lock">adds:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">My fathers that name have revered on a throne;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">My fathers have fallen to right it.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Those fathers would spurn their degenerate son,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">That name should he scoffingly slight it.</div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Still, in pray’rs for King George, I must heartily join</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The Queen and the rest of the gentry:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Be they wise, be they foolish, is nothing of mine;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Their title’s avow’d by my country.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">But why of that epocha make such a fuss,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">That gave us the Hanover stem?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If bringing them over was lucky for us,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I’m sure ’twas as lucky for them.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">But loyalty truce! we’re on dangerous ground,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Who knows how the fashions may alter?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The doctrine to-day, that is loyalty sound,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To-morrow may bring us a halter.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This sort of reserve was practised by many Jacobites,
in London, as well as in Scotland. There was
no knowing what might happen. In 1770, the French
minister, De Choiseul, was strongly disposed to help
Charles Edward to be crowned at Westminster, but
that prince was so helplessly drunk when he arrived at
the minister’s house in Paris that he was at once sent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span>
back. But the hapless adventurer never lost all hope
of finding himself in the Hall or the Abbey. In 1779,
Wraxall says that Charles Edward exhibited to the
world a very humiliating spectacle. Mrs. Piozzi, on
the margin of her copy, wrote—‘Still more so at
Florence, in 1786. Count Alfieri had taken away his
consort, and he was under the dominion and care of a
natural daughter who wore the Garter and was called
Duchess of Albany. She checked him when he drank
too much or when he talked too much. Though one
evening, he called Mr. Greathead up to him, and said
in good English, and in a loud though cracked voice:
“I will speak to my own subjects in my own way,
Sir; aye! and I will soon speak to you, Sir, in Westminster
Hall!”’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE COUNT OF ALBANY.</i></div>

<p>While the Count of Albany was thus dreamily
looking towards London, and the Scottish poet was
playfully hesitating in his allegiance, there was a Jacobite
whose neck was once very near the noose of the
halter, but who now was a man whom the Hanoverian
king delighted to honour.</p>

<p>There is no more perfect illustration of the now
utter nothingness of Jacobitism than may be found in
an incident which took place at St. James’s this year,
namely, the knighting of a man who had fought at
Culloden and forged notes in the service of Charles
Edward, whom he looked upon as his king, and which
king was still existing in Italy. That man was the
celebrated engraver, Robert Strange.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ROBERT STRANGE.</i></div>

<p>Strange was an Orcadean lad, who was early destined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span>
to study law, but who, hating the study, entered
on board a man-of-war, out of intense love of the sea,
and grew sick of it in half a year. He turned to what
he hated, and seated himself on a high stool in the law
office of his brother David, in Edinburgh. But there
the real natural bent of his genius declared itself, and
he was discovered, after drawing drafts of deeds, leases
and covenants, drawing portraits, buildings, and landscapes,
on the back of them. David was a sensible
man: he straightway articled his brother Robin to
Cooper, the celebrated engraver, for six years. Robin
served his time with credit to himself. The world of
art still profits by Robin’s assiduity. He was out of
his time, and twenty-three years of age when, in 1744,
bonnie Isabella Lumisden’s beauty made prisoner of
his soul. ‘No man may be lover of mine,’ said Isabella,
‘who is not ready to fight for my prince.’
Strange, forthwith, became Isabella’s slave and
Charles Edward’s soldier. Isabella’s father, also her
better known brother, Andrew Lumisden, and herself,
were uncompromising Jacobites. Robin became as
<em>ultra</em> as any of them. His first contribution to the
cause was an engraved likeness of Charles Edward.
His second was his plate of a promissory note, for
the paper currency by which the Jacobite army was
to pay its way, the note to be duly cashed after the
Restoration of the Stuart dynasty! Robin became
the prince’s ‘moneyer,’ and a gentleman of his Life
Guards. Strange went through it all, from the first
fray to the overthrow at Culloden. He escaped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span>
from the field, played a terrible game of hide-and-seek
for his life, and at last reached Edinburgh. His old
master Cooper is quoted by Robin’s biographer, Dennistoun,
as his authority for saying that, ‘when hotly
pressed, Strange dashed into the room where his lady
(Isabella Lumisden), whose zeal had enlisted him in the
fatal cause, sat singing at her needlework, and, failing
other means of concealment, was indebted for safety
to her prompt invention. As she quietly raised her
hooped gown, the affianced lover quickly disappeared
beneath its ample contour; where, thanks to her cool
demeanour and unfaltering notes, he lay undetected
while the rude and baffled soldiery vainly ransacked
the house.’ Strange escaped, but he returned to
Edinburgh, where he privately engraved portraits
of the chiefs in both factions, and drew designs for
fans, which were sold in London as well as in Edinburgh.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>STRANGE’S ADVENTURES.</i></div>

<p>There is a mystery as to how such a double offender
as Strange—rebel soldier and fabricator of fictitious
bank-notes—was allowed to live unmolested in Edinburgh.
He himself, though now never ‘wanted,’ in a
police sense, grew uneasy. He married Isabella Lumisden
in 1747, and for some years he was better known
to the Jacobite colony at Rouen,—and in other cities—than
he was at home. Mrs. Strange devoted her children
to the Jacobite cause. In the cap of her first-born, a
daughter, she fastened a couple of white roses; and she
wrote of her second, Mary Bruce:—‘I have taken great
care of her education. For instance: whenever she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span>
hears the word <em>whig</em> mentioned, she grins and makes
faces that would frighten a bear; but when I name the
Prince, she kisses me and looks at her picture; and
greets you well for sending the pretty gumflower. I
intend she shall wear it <em>at the coronation</em>.’ The Jacobite
lady hoped to see <em>that</em>, and to let her windows
at great profit when James <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> should pass by there
to Holyrood.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>STRANGE IN LONDON.</i></div>

<p>Strange led a somewhat wandering life, but always
for great purposes of art, while his family remained in
Scotland. He was even in London, all Jacobite and
unpardoned as he was, in the year of the accession of
George <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>; in which year Walpole wrote to Mann,
at Florence:—‘I am going to give a letter for you to
Strange, the engraver, who is going to visit Italy. He
is a first-rate artist, and by far our best. Pray countenance
him, though you may not approve his politics.
I believe Albano’ (the residence of the Chevalier de
St. George) ‘is his Loretto.’</p>

<p><a id="chg7"></a>In Italy, Jacobite Strange not only triumphantly
pursued his career as an engraver, but proved himself
a far more profitable agent in purchasing foreign
pictures for English connoisseurs at home, than Hanoverian
Dalton. In 1765, he was applying to Lord
Bute, as a loyal subject, to be allowed to live without
fear of molestation in London. After the death of the
old Chevalier, this liberty was granted to whomsoever
cared to apply for it. Strange and his family then
settled in fashionable Castle Street, Leicester Square.
The Whigs in the Society of Artists raised obstacles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>
to his being elected a member; but ultimately the
Jacobite disappeared in the glory of the artist. The
somewhat ignoble scattering of the old Chevalier’s
servants caused Andrew Lumisden, his under-secretary
of state, to look anxiously towards the English metropolis.
His sister was anxious he should take leave
with all becomingness. She wrote to him from, now
dingy, Castle Street:—‘I entreat the person whom I
never saw’ (Cardinal York) ‘but, even for his father
and family’s sake, I ever loved, to, if possible, patch up
things so as, in the eyes of the world, you may bid a
respectful farewell. I could walk barefoot to kneel for
this favour.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>NEW HOPES.</i></div>

<p>Andrew Lumisden, however, was not among the
Jacobites who would venture to London on mere word
of mouth permission. His sister encouraged him in
this hesitation. In a letter from Castle Street, 1773,
she alludes to the subject, and also to the new hopes
that fluttered the bosoms of her Jacobite friends, and
which were raised on the marriage, in the preceding year,
of Charles Edward with the Princess Louise of Stolberg:—‘I
have not yet heard of your letter of liberty.
Col. Masterton says it is lying in Lord North’s office,
and he is sure you will be safe to come here. But I
say we must have better security than that. Whatever
I learn, you shall know without loss of time....
When will you write me of a pregnancy? On that I
depend. It is my last stake.... As my good Lady
Clackmannan says: “O, my dear, send me something
to raise my spirits in these bad times!” Remember me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>
to the good Principle Gordon, and all our honest’
(that is, Jacobite) ‘friends.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>STRANGE AT ST. JAMES’S.</i></div>

<p>Five years more elapsed before the ultra-Jacobite
Andrew Lumisden was seen traversing Leicester Fields,
a free man, in safety. He owed his freedom, it is said,
to the zeal and judgment shown by him in executing a
commission (entrusted to him by Lord Hillsborough)
to purchase for George <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> some rare books at a great
sale in Paris. Strange himself had become a great
master of his art, the glory of the English school of
engravers. There was still some distance kept between
Robin and the Court of St, James’s. He had declined
to engrave a portrait of George <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>, and also one of
George <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>, by Ramsay. His reason was not ill-founded,
namely, that no engraving could be creditably
executed where the original painting was very defective.
Be this as it may, the old Jacobite effected a
reconciliation by engraving West’s picture of the apotheosis
of the young princes—Octavius and Alfred.
Strange’s untameable Jacobite wife, who had never
spoken of George <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> but as ‘Elector of Hanover’ or
‘Duke of Brunswick,’ now awarded him and his queen
their full title, in a letter addressed to her son Robert,
in January, 1787, written in Strange’s new London
residence, ‘the Golden Head, Henrietta Street, Covent
Garden,’ and containing an account of the honours
heaped on her husband, in recognition of his last
labours. ‘Your dear father has been employed in
engraving a most beautiful picture painted by Mr.
West, which he liked so much that he was desirous to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span>
make a print from it.
<span class="sni"><i>THE JACOBITE KNIGHTED.</i></span>
The picture was painted for his
Majesty; it represented two of the royal children who
died. The composition is an angel in the clouds, the
first child sitting by the angel; and the other, a most
sweet youth, looking up. There are two cherubs in the
top, and a view of Windsor at the bottom. This piece
was lately finished, and Friday, the 5th currt., was
appointed for your father’s presenting some proofs of it
to his Majesty. He went with them to the Queen’s house
and had a most gracious reception. His Majesty was
very much pleased. After saying many most flattering
things, he said, “Mr. Strange, I have another
favour to ask of you.” Your father was attentive, and
his Majesty—“It is that you attend the levee on
Wednesday or Friday, that I may confer on you the
honour of knighthood.” His Majesty left the room,
but, coming quickly back, said, “I am going immediately
to St. James’s; if you’ll follow me I’ll do it now;
the sooner the better.” So, calling one of the pages,
gave him orders to conduct Mr. Strange to St. James’s,
where, kneeling down, he rose up <span class="smcap">Sir Robert Strange</span>!
This honour to our family is, I hope, a very good
omen. I hope it will be a spur to our children, and
show them to what virtue and industry may bring
them. My dear Bob, I hope you will equally share
in our virtues as you do in our honours: honours and
virtue ought never to part. Few families have ever
had a more sure or creditable foundation than ours.
May laurels flourish on all your brows!’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>SIR ROBERT AND LADY STRANGE.</i></div>

<p>It is a custom to speak in the present day of law<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span>
and justice being a mere farce, and of a rogue having
a better chance than his victim, before a full bench of
judges splitting hairs and disagreeing in the interpretation
and application of the law. But the ‘handy
dandy’ of law and justice was as confusing in the
London of the Jacobite times. Cameron, young
Matthews the printer, the thoughtless youths who were
‘captains’ in the Manchester regiment, were harmless
in what they did, compared with Strange, the young
Chevalier’s life-guardsman, and forger of flash notes;
but they were hanged and Robin was knighted! Of
course, Strange was not knighted for his Jacobite
doings, but for his distinction as an artist. One may
at least be sorry that the other Jacobites were strangled
at Tyburn and on Kennington Common.</p>

<p>Sir Robert was grateful. In future royal dedications
the ex-Jacobite spoke of the king’s mother as
‘that august princess.’ George, the king, was ‘the
auspicious patron of art.’ Sir Robert ‘presumed to
flatter himself’ that he might ‘humbly lay his work at
his Majesty’s feet;’ that ‘millions prayed for him,’—the
‘Arbiter of Taste and the beloved Father of his people.’
And ‘the king over the Water’ was still (though
scarcely) alive. Robin survived Charles Edward, and
died in 1791. His widow lived till 1806. With full
recognition of the ‘happy establishment,’ Lady Strange
never doubted the superior rights of the Stuarts, and
was angry and outspoken when such rights were, in
any sense, questioned. At one of her gatherings in
Henrietta Street, one of her guests happened to refer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span>
to Charles Edward as the ‘Pretender.’ This stirred
the old lady’s Jacobite blood, and with a license not
uncommon to aged Scottish ladies of the time, in
moments of excitement, she thundered out, ‘<em>Pretender!</em>
and be damned to you! <em>Pretender</em>, indeed!’—Flora
Macdonald did not swear at such provocation, but it
once brought her fist in ringing acquaintance with
the offender’s ears.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>DEATH OF CHARLES EDWARD.</i></div>

<p>In the year 1788 the poor prince, to designate
whom as a ‘Pretender’ was so offensive to all Jacobites,
died in Rome, on the night of a terrible anniversary
for the Stuart family, the 30th of January.
In all the London periodicals he was treated with
courtesy, but his death moved London society much
less than that of ‘Athenian Stuart,’ whose decease left
a void in scientific and social companies. The funeral
ceremony is detailed in brief common-places. A very
mild defender of the prince, ‘Anglicanus,’ in the
‘Gentleman’s Magazine’ (Anno 1788, p. 509), adds to
the confusion touching Charles Edward’s religion, by
asserting that he was converted to Protestantism in
Gray’s Inn Lane; and proving the assertion by asking,
‘Did he not read the Church of England prayers to
his domestics when no clergyman was present?’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE COUNTESS OF ALBANY, AT COURT.</i></div>

<p>Soon after, London became an asylum to a fugitive
‘Queen.’ In 1791, the French revolution drove the
widow of Charles Edward to leave Paris and seek a
refuge in London. The Countess of Albany must have
felt some surprise at finding herself well received in St.
James’s Palace by the king and queen. She was there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>
by force ‘of that tupsy-turvy-hood which characterises
the present age,’ as some wit remarked, at a supper at
Lady Mount-Edgcumbe’s. She was presented by the
young Countess of Aylesbury (of that Jacobite family)
as Princess of Stolberg. Walpole’s record is:—‘She
was well-dressed and not at all embarrassed. The
King talked to her a good deal, but about her passage,
the sea, and general topics. The Queen in the same
way, but less. Then she stood between the Dukes of
Gloucester and Clarence, and had a good deal of conversation
with the former, who perhaps may have met
her in Italy. Not a word between her and the Princesses,
nor did I hear of the Prince; but he was there,
and probably spoke to her. The Queen looked at her
earnestly. To add to the singularity of the day, it is
the Queen’s birthday. Another odd accident, at the
Opera, at the Pantheon, Mme. d’Albany was carried into
the King’s box, and sat there. It is not of a piece
with her going to Court, that she seals with the royal
arms.’ Walpole thought that ‘curiosity’ partly
brought her to London; and that it was not very well
bred to her late husband’s family, ‘nor very sensible,
but a new way of passing eldest.’ He had not then
seen her, and when he did, at the end of May, his
report was: ‘She has not a ray of royalty about her.
She has good eyes and teeth, but, I think, can have
had no more beauty than remains, except youth. She
is civil and easy, but German and ordinary. Lady
Aylesbury made a small assembly for her on Monday,
and my curiosity is satisfied.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS.</i></div>

<p>On the old Chevalier’s birthday, the 10th of June,
Dr. Beilby Porteus, Bishop of London, escorted Hannah
More to the House of Lords, to hear the king deliver
the speech by which he prorogued Parliament. On
that once famous day for defiantly wearing a white
rose and risking mortal combat in consequence, the
Countess of Albany ‘chose to go to see the King in the
House of Lords, with the crown on his head, proroguing
the Parliament.’ ‘What an odd rencontre!’ says
Walpole, ‘was it philosophy or insensibility?’ and he
adds his belief, without stating the grounds for it,
‘that her husband was in Westminster Hall at the
Coronation.’ Hannah More was being ‘very well
entertained’ with the speech; but the thing that was
most amusing, as she prettily described it, ‘was to see,
among the ladies, the Princess of Stolberg, Countess of
Albany, wife of the Pretender, sitting just at the foot
of that throne which she might once have expected to
have mounted; and what diverted the party when I
put them in mind of it, was that it happened to be the
10th of June, <em>the Pretender’s birthday</em>! I have the
honour to be very much like her, and this opinion was
confirmed yesterday when we met again.’</p>

<p>It has been seen what Walpole and others thought
of the Jacobites’ queen when she came to London.
The lady kept a diary during her sojourn here, from
which may be collected her opinions of the English
and England of her day.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE COUNTESS, ON ENGLISH SOCIETY.</i></div>

<p>The widow of Charles Edward found England
generally, and London in particular, much duller than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span>
even she had expected. She saw crowds but no society.
People lived nine months in the country, and during
the three months in town they were never at home, but
were running after one another. They who were not confined
half or all the year with gout, went to bed at
four, got up at midday, and began the morning at two
in the afternoon. There was no sun, but much smoke,
heavy meals, and hard drinking. The husbands were
fond and ill-tempered; the wives good from a sense of
risk rather than disinclination for their being otherwise,
and they loved gaming and dissipation. There was a
family life, but no intimate social life; no taste nor
capacity for art. The most striking part of the judgment
of the Countess of Albany refers to English laws
and constitution. ‘The only good,’ she says in her
Diary, ‘which England enjoys, and which is inappreciable,
is political liberty.... If England had an oppressive
government, this country together with its people
would be the last in the universe: bad climate, bad
soil, and consequently tasteless productions. It is only
the excellence of its government that makes it habitable.’
This judgment of England by a Jacobite
princess or queen, whose husband would have changed
all but the climate, is at least interesting. In England
the Duchess of Devonshire and many other ladies
treated her as ‘queen.’ ‘The flattery’ (says the
‘Edinburgh Review,’ July, 1861, p. 170), ‘which the
writers probably regarded as polite <i lang="fr">badinage</i>, was accepted
as rightful homage by the countess.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>HANOVERIAN JACOBITES.</i></div>

<p>Her sojourn in England was from April to August.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span>
Her design to visit the scenes in Scotland which her
late husband had rendered historical, was obliged to be
given up for lack of means; and she became, but not
till the death of the Cardinal of York, the recipient of
an annuity from George <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> This king, like many of
his family before him, and like all after him, had a
strong feeling of sympathy with the Stuarts. Indeed,
the recognised Jacobitism of the king, and of the royal
family in general, was the apology made by friends of
the Stuart for holding office under what they had once
called ‘the usurping family.’ Hogg (‘Jacobite Relics’)
has recorded that a gentleman in a large company once
gibed Captain Stuart of Invernahoyle, for holding the
king’s commission while he was, at the same time, a
professed Jacobite. ‘So I well may,’ answered he,
‘in imitation of my master; the king himself is a
Jacobite.’ The gentleman shook his head, and remarked
that the king was impossible. ‘By G—!’ said Stuart,
‘but I tell you he is, and every son that he has. There
is not one of them who, if he had lived in my brave
father’s days, would not to a certainty have been
hanged.’</p>

<p>The public learned, in 1793, how different the
‘family feeling’ had been in the past generation. The
‘Monthly Review’ (in August of that year), in a notice
of the Memoirs of the Marshal Duke de Richelieu, states
that the temporary refuge offered to Charles Edward
in Friburg, after his expulsion from France, highly
displeased the Court at St. James’s. The British
minister wrote in a very haughty style to the magistrates<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span>
of that State, complaining that it afforded an
asylum to an odious race proscribed by the laws of
Great Britain. This was answered by L’Avoyer with
proper spirit. ‘This odious race,’ said he, ‘is not
proscribed by our laws. Your letter is highly improper.
You forget that you are writing to a sovereign State;
and I do not conceive myself obliged to give you any
further answer.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>JACOBITE BALLADS.</i></div>

<p>In corroboration of the better feeling of the reigning
family for that of the Stuarts, Hogg chronicles an act of
graceful homage to loyalty to the Stuarts (on the part of
the Prince Regent), which is graceful if it be true. He
was heard to express himself one day, before a dozen
gentlemen of both nations, with the greatest warmth, as
follows: ‘I have always regarded the attachment of
the Scots to the Pretender—I beg your pardon, gentlemen,
to Prince Charles Stuart I mean—as a lesson to
me whom to trust in the hour of need!’</p>

<p>The feeling of regard for those who had been true
to the Stuarts was, no doubt, genuine. It was certainly
shared by the regent’s brothers, the Dukes of Clarence
and Sussex. At a meeting of the ‘Highland Society
of London,’ when the Duke of Sussex was in the chair,
a suggestion was made to Colonel Stuart of Garth, that
it was desirable to rescue from oblivion the songs and
ballads of the Jacobite period, by collecting and printing
them. Colonel Stuart readily adopted the suggestion,
which may be said to have been made by the
royal family, in the person of one of its members; and
ultimately the task of collecting devolved on ‘the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span>
Ettrick Shepherd.’ Hogg published a first volume in
1819, the second in 1822. Some of the songs were
his own, after the old tunes and fashions. The
genuine Jacobite ballads excited much attention;
old Jacobites were amused rather than gratified by
viewing Cumberland in Hell, and younger people
whose sympathies had first been awakened (in 1805)
by ‘Waverley,’ were subdued to a sentiment of love
and pity for the Stuart whose sufferings are detailed in
song, and the loyalty of whose adherents is so touchingly
illustrated in ardent, sometimes ferociously
attuned, minstrelsy. The republication of these
‘Jacobite Relics,’ by Mr. Gardner, of Paisley, in 1874,
is a proof that the old interest has not died out either
in London or the kingdoms generally.</p>

<div class="sidenote">‘<i>HENRY THE NINTH.</i>’</div>

<p>Meanwhile, the French revolutionary wave reached
Rome, and it ruined ‘Henry the Ninth, by the Grace of
God, but not by the will of men, King of Great Britain,
France, and Ireland,’ as it did his sister-in-law, the
Countess of Albany. Cardinal York did not seek
refuge in London: he found one in Venice. In London,
however, Sir John Cave Hippisley, having been informed
of the venerable Cardinal’s destitute condition,
submitted the lamentable case of this Prince of the
Church to the Ministry (February, 1800). Almost
immediately, in the king’s name, an offer by letter was
made to him of a pension of 4,000<abbr title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr> a year. ‘The
letter,’ wrote the Cardinal to Sir John, in Grosvenor
Street, ‘is written in so extremely genteel and obliging
a manner, and with expressions of singular regard and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span>
consideration for me, that, I assure you, excited in me
most particular and lively sentiments, not only of satisfaction
for the delicacy with which the affair has been
managed, but also of gratitude for the generosity
which has provided for my necessity.’ The Cardinal
adds a touching statement of his utter destitution. Sir
John was right in informing the still illustrious prince
that the king’s action had the sympathy of the whole
British nation, irrespective of creeds and parties.
‘Your gracious Sovereign’s noble and spontaneous
generosity,’ rejoins the Cardinal, ‘filled me with the most
lively sensations of tenderness and heartfelt gratitude.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>HOME’S HISTORY OF THE REBELLION.</i></div>

<p>In 1802, Cadell and Davies, in the Strand, published
the first regular history of the rebellion of 1745, and
the London critics expressed their surprise that more
than half a century had elapsed before a trustworthy
account of so serious an outbreak had been given to
the public. The key-note of Home’s book is in a paragraph
which was very distasteful to the Jacobites.
There it was laid down that the Revolution of 1688,
which transferred the Crown ‘to the nearest protestant
heir, but more remote than several Roman Catholic
families, gave such an ascendant to popular principles
as puts the nature of the constitution beyond all controversy.’
The critics with Jacobite tendencies were
disappointed that Home cast no censure on the Duke
of Cumberland. They supposed this was owing to the
book being dedicated to the king. Jacobite disappointment
found ample compensation in 1805, when
romance flung all its splendour round the young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>
Chevalier, in the novel by an anonymous author,
‘Waverley, or ’tis 60 years since.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A JACOBITE DRAMA.</i></div>

<p>The last male heir of the royal Stuart line was
then living. The good Cardinal York died in 1807 at
Rome, when he was eighty-two years of age. The
announcement of his death in the London journals
shows sympathy and respect, without stint. It was
well deserved, for he was a blameless prince of a not
irreproachable line.</p>

<p>After this last male heir of the line of Stuart had
died, with a dignity that characterised no other of his
race, and with the respectful sympathy of his adversaries,
if he had any, it might be supposed that all
danger springing from such a line had ceased. The
last of the race had abandoned the empty title of king,
and had gracefully and without humiliation accepted
a pension, gracefully and delicately offered, from
George <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> The peril, however, was not supposed to
be over. While the last of the Stuarts was dying,
Mr. Charles Kemble was translating a French drama
(originally German, by Kotzebue), entitled ‘Edouard
en Ecosse.’ On presenting it in 1808 to the Lord
Chamberlain and the Licenser, they did not see treason
in it, but much offence. The piece, in fact, represented
the chances, mischances, adventures, and escapes of
Charles Edward after the battle of Culloden. A
licence to play a three-act drama, tending to keep up
interest in ‘the Pretender,’ was refused point blank.
Ultimately, it was granted under absurd conditions.
<span class="sni"><i>THE DRAMA REVISED.</i></span>
Charles Kemble removed the scene to Sweden, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span>
called his drama ‘The Wanderer, or the Rights of
Hospitality.’ Charles Edward (played by Kemble)
became Sigismond, Culloden figured as the battle of
Strangebro, and everything suffered silly change, except
one character, which was overlooked—Ramsay (Fawcett)—who
throughout the play talked in the broadest
Scotch. When Sigismond’s perils culminated, he melodramatically
escaped them all, and those who had
helped him were proud of their aid, and not in much
fear for having given it. More than twenty years
elapsed before the great official at St. James’s thought
that the original version might be acted without danger
to the throne of George <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> In November, 1829, it
was produced at Covent Garden as the ‘Royal Fugitive,
or the Rights of Hospitality.’ Charles was played
by the ex-artillery officer, Prescott, whose stage name
was Warde. Diddear and Miss Tree acted the Duke
and Duchess of Athol; Miss Cawse represented Flora
Macdonald; and the terrible Duke William was roared
through like a sucking dove by the milk-and-watery
Horrebow. The drama did not shake the ‘happy
establishment.’ Of the performers in 1829, one alone
survives, the representative of the Duchess of Athol,
Mrs. Charles Kean.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>SATIRICAL BALLAD.</i></div>

<p>But, five years previous to abandoning the timidity
which saw danger in the stage dealing with a Stuart
drama, a total change came over the governing powers
in London. George <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> and Alderman Curtis had
appeared in Edinburgh, in Highland garb, in 1822, and
this led to an act of grace in 1824. The king’s visit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span>
to Scotland, however, did arouse a slumbering Jacobite
bard, who gave vent to his rough humour in a satire,
copies of which reached London in the king’s absence,
and the flavour of which may be gathered from the
following <span class="lock">extracts:—</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>REVERSAL OF ATTAINDERS.</i></div>

<p>The successful royal visit to Scotland led to some
happy results. On Monday, May 24th, 1824, the Earl
of Liverpool rose to inform the House of Lords that
he had the king’s command to present bills for restoring
the honours of several families which had been forfeited
by attainder. The royal visit to Scotland, the first
which any king had made since the Revolution, had
led certain persons of undoubted loyalty to be relieved
from the effects of the attainder which, he would not
dispute, had been justly levelled against their disloyal
ancestors. The king was gracious, the Crown was
discreet. Four peerages had been selected for restoration,
viz., the Earldom of Mar, in the person of John
Erskine; the Viscountship of Kenmure (John Gordon);
the Earldom of Perth and Viscountship of Strathallan
to James Drummond; and the title of Lord Nairn to
William Nairn. It was also proposed to reverse the
attainder of Lord Stafford.</p>

<p>The Earl of Lauderdale warned the Government to
be quite sure that James Drummond had any claims,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span>
before they restored the above two titles. The
Earl of Radnor thought the proceeding a very extraordinary
one. Ultimately the Bill was read a first
time.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>DEBATE IN THE COMMONS.</i></div>

<p>On June 4th, the Commons agreed to a proposition
from the Lords that, considering Mr. Erskine’s age and
infirmity, the Bill to restore him to the forfeited earldom
should be proceeded with. Mr. Erskine was
unable to come up to London to take the indispensable
preparatory oaths. He found ready grace from an
unanimous House.</p>

<p>When, ten days later, the Bills were read a second
time in the Commons, the restoration of the blood of
Stafford (attainted in 1680) was recognised as an act of
justice; that of the Jacobite peers as one of grace and
favour. Captain Bruce expressed the pain he felt that
while this grace and favour cleared the taint in the
blood of the lineal descendants of those who had
forfeited title and estates, such grace was kept from
descendants of collaterals; and but for this prohibition
he himself would now be Lord Burleigh. To which
Lord Binning added the remark that, by old Scottish
law, the claims of a collateral branch were not estreated
by forfeiture.</p>

<p>Mr. Peel rejoined that there were only two courses—indiscriminate
reversal of all the attainders, or impartial
selection. As to the first, some of the lineal
descendants did not desire restoration, on considerations
of property. Government, he said, had selected
those respecting whom no doubt existed with regard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span>
to the original patent; and he spoke with reverence of
the earldom of Mar, which existed prior to any records
of parliament.</p>

<p>The result was that king and parliament at Westminster,
in this year 1824, restored the following
forfeited titles:—Erskine, Lord Erskine, Earl of Mar;
Gordon, Lord Lochinvar and Viscount Kenmure;
Nairn, Lord Nairn; and Drummond, Lord Maderty,
Drummond of Cromlix, and Viscount Strathallan.
The Viscount Strathallan restored this year was a
descendant of the viscount who was slain at Culloden,
but who was styled in the Whig London papers as
‘Mr. Drummond.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A TRANSPONTINE PLAY.</i></div>

<p>A minor incident, yet a characteristic one, may
here be mentioned. The power which in 1808 had
prohibited the counterfeit presentment on the stage
of Charles Edward, could not obstruct those of
George <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> and all his family, in 1824, at the ‘Coburg.’
This house, being in Surrey, was beyond the jurisdiction
of the Lord Chamberlain’s office. The drama,
acted in defiance of him and of good taste, was called
‘George the Third, the Father of his People.’ The
defunct king (acted by Bengough, who singularly
resembled him), and the deceased Queen Charlotte,
with her inseparable snuff-box, next delighted the
Transpontines with their gracious presence; but tenfold
more delight and amusement were caused by the
presence of all the living members of the royal family.
In noticing this singular piece, the ‘Morning Chronicle’
gave a Jacobite (or perhaps a Jacobin) flavour to its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span>
criticism. The title, it argued, was disrespectful to
George <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> It is always the king on the throne who
is the Father of his People. George <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>, therefore,
should have been styled the Grandfather of his People!
Again, in the drama, the latter is called ‘the best of
kings,’ a designation which is the right of the king in
possession; therefore, said the ‘Chronicle,’ George <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>
was ‘the second best,’ or the author might have called
him ‘the best but one.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE BODY OF JAMES THE SECOND.</i></div>

<p>It is a singular coincidence that the same year in
which four Jacobite peerages were relieved from
attainder, the remains of James <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> were discovered at
St. Germain. The body was for many years ‘deposited’
in the chapel of the English Benedictines, Paris—body,
<em>minus</em> heart, brains, and bowels, entombed in various
places, to which places English Jacobites used to resort
as to holy shrines. The leaders of civilisation, at the
outbreak of the Revolution, smashed the urns containing
brains, &amp;c., and scattered the contents. The body at
the Benedictines was treated with similar indignity;
but, in a mutilated form, it was privately interred at
St. Germain. No mark was set on the place, and it
was forgotten, but was discovered this year in the
course of rebuilding a part of the church. Information
of this discovery was sent to London by our ambassador,
to whom orders were sent from Downing Street
to see the remains re-interred with every religious ceremony
that could manifest respect.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CEREMONY AT ST. GERMAIN.</i></div>

<p>On the 7th of September, the Paris papers announced
that a solemn mass would be celebrated on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span>
the 9th, and invited the attendance of all British subjects
on this solemn occasion. Now, this invitation of
the Paris authorities to British subjects to attend the
funeral service in honour of the re-depositing of what
remained of the body of James <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>, puzzled rather than
excited the London journals. Writers therein protested
against this service, if thereby the legitimate right of
the Stuarts was recognised, or confession was made
that service for the dead could get a soul in or out of
purgatory. Sly hits were made against Lord Eldon,
the keeper of the king’s conscience, for ordering such
a mass at a period when he was in the habit of toasting
the Protestant ascendency. Many persons—the most
of them, it is to be hoped, moved by praiseworthy
sympathies—went from London to be present at the
ceremony. It was solemn and dignified. Distinguished
persons, bearing familiar names of the old
Jacobite times, were present. Marshal Macdonald and
the Duke of Fitz-James were amongst them. By a
curious coincidence, the British ambassador in France
was then a Stuart—Sir Charles Stuart, afterwards
Lord Stuart de Rothesay. He placed a royal diadem
of gold beneath a black crape veil, on the coffin, and
this graceful act of homage was in appropriate harmony
with the restoration, as far as it could be effected,
of the descendants of those who had suffered in the
Jacobite cause, to the long forfeited titles of their
ancestors.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>SOMETHING NEW.</i></div>

<p>It really now seemed as if the curtain had fallen on
the great Jacobite drama, and that it would not be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>
possible to cause it to rise again for an additional act
or for a farce succeeding to the tragic drama. In the
year 1826, indeed, there was a little graceful episode,
namely, the restoration of the titles of Ogilvie, Lord
Ogilvie and Earl of Airly; of Dalzell, Lord Dalzell
and Earl of Carnwath; and of Sutherland, Lord Duffus.
But, not only while these acts of grace were being
enacted, but for many years before and many years
afterwards, a course of action was being taken which
was intended to revive the whole question, and to put
on the stage the old Jacobite play, with alterations,
improvements, new actors, and an entirely new
<i lang="fr">dénouement</i>. London did not become aware of this till
about the year 1847. In Scotland, however, there
had long been expectancy raised of ‘something new,’
which will appear in Jacobite incidents under Queen
Victoria.</p>

<span class="smcap">eorge Selwyn</span> excused himself for
going to see Simon Fraser Lord Lovat lose
his head at the block, by going to see it
sewn on again. That last head sacrificed
wore a title which was the first restored by Her Majesty
after her accession. Old Lovat’s son, whom his father
forced into rebellion, and whom that exemplary parent
would have hanged, if he could have saved his own life
by it, became a distinguished General in the British
service. General Fraser and his half-brother Archibald
died, without surviving heirs. Old Lovat was the
thirteenth lord, leaving a title under attainder. As
early as 1825, Sir Thomas Fraser of Lovat and Strichen
claimed the ancient barony as a son of the sixth lord,
who died in 1557. Their Lordships at Westminster
had made no progress towards making the claimant a
Baron, when Her Majesty ascended the throne. The
Queen settled the claim at once by creating Sir Thomas
Fraser, Baron Lovat in the United Kingdom. The new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span>
Lord Lovat, however, still coveted the older and therefore
grander dignity. He persisted in asserting his
right to possess the Scottish title, in spite of the attainder
which smote the lord who was beheaded on Tower
Hill. After twenty years’ consideration, the Peers at
Westminster were advised that the assertion was a
correct one; and, in 1857, they acceded to his demand.
That was exactly three hundred years after the death
of the sixth lord, through whom the claimant asserted
his right to the title.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>OLD JACOBITE TITLES.</i></div>

<p>In a way something similar was another restoration
of a Jacobite title effected in London. Of all the lords
who were tried for their lives (1716 and 1746 included),
there was not one who bore himself so gallantly as the
son of the illustrious House of Seton, the Earl of
Wintoun. All the Jacobite peers who pleaded guilty,
petitioned for mercy, and returned to a treasonable
outspokenness, when they failed to obtain forgiveness
for an avowed crime. Even brave Balmerino cried
<cite>peccavi!</cite> and got nothing by it. But noble Wintoun
pleaded that he was not guilty in fighting on what he
considered the just side; when he was condemned to
death he refused to beg for his life; and he showed
his contempt for the Act of Grace, by anticipating it in
an act of his own,—escaping from the Tower to the
continent. He was the fifth earl, and his attainder
barred the way to any heir of his own. But, in 1840,
the fifteenth Earl of Eglinton proved his descent from
a preceding earl, of whom he was forthwith served heir
male general, and a new dignity was added to the roll
of Lord Eglinton’s titles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>MORE RESTORATIONS.</i></div>

<p>In the following year, the Committee of Privileges
went to the work of restoration of Jacobite forfeitures
with unusual alacrity. On their advice, an Act of
Parliament was passed which declared that Mr. William
Constable Maxwell, of Nithsdale and Everingham, and
all the other descendants of William Maxwell, Earl of
Nithsdale and Lord Herries, were restored in blood.
There the Act left them. As far as they were of the
blood of Winifred Herbert, noble daughter of the
House of Pembroke, the ill-requited wife of the puling
peer whom she rescued from death, their blood was
free from all taint, in spite of any Act. Mr. Maxwell
could not claim the earldom, but the way was open for
him to the barony once held by the unworthy earl,
and in 1850, he was the acknowledged Lord Herries.</p>

<p>Three years later, Her Majesty despatched a ‘special
command and recommendation’ to Parliament, which
was speedily obeyed. It was to the effect that the Parliament
should restore George Drummond to the forfeited
Jacobite titles of Earl of Perth and Viscount Melfort
the dignities of Lord Drummond of Stobhall, Lord
Drummond of Montifex, and Lord Drummond of Bickerton,
Castlemaine, and Galstoun, and to the exercise of
the hereditary offices of Thane of Lennox and Steward
of Strathearn. The peer who in 1824 advised Lord
Liverpool to be sure he had got hold of the right Mr.
Drummond, when recommending one for restoration to
the peerage, had some reason for the course taken by
him. However, in this case, where there are so many
Drummonds, Parliament could hardly have been mistaken.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span>
That body having fulfilled the Queen’s ‘command
and recommendation,’ Her Majesty gave her
assent; and then, as if the better to identify the Drummond
who was restored to so many titles, record was
gravely made that ‘born in 1807, he was baptised at
St. Marylebone Church,’ Hogarth’s church, of course.</p>

<p>In 1855 the act of attainder which had struck the
Earl of Southesk (Lord Carnegie) for the share he took
in the little affair (which intended a good deal) in 1718,
was quietly reversed, at Westminster, where it had
been originally passed.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE CROMARTIE TITLE.</i></div>

<p>Not so quietly was effected the next business entailed
on Parliament, by the Jacobite rebellion,—or,
rather, the business was assumed by Her Majesty herself,
if any business can be assumed by an irresponsible
sovereign whose ministers have to answer for everything
done in that sovereign’s name. The title of Earl
of Cromartie (with its inferior titles once worn by the
head of the house of Mackenzie) was, and still is,
under attainder. But there was a great heiress, Miss
Annie Hay Mackenzie, who, in 1849, married the
Duke of Sutherland. In 1861, the queen <em>created</em> this
lady Countess of Cromartie, Viscountess Tarbat of
Tarbat, Baroness Castlehaven, and Baroness Macleod of
Castle Leod, in her own right, with limitation of succession
to her second son Francis and his heirs;—the elder
succeeding to the Dukedom.</p>

<p>The latest restoration was by legal process. Among
the minor unfortunates whose Jacobitism was punished
by forfeiture, was a Lord Balfour of Burleigh. In 1869,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span>
Mr. Bruce, of Kennett, Clackmannan, gained his suit to
Parliament, and recovered that resonant title; and it
is said that the modern Balfour of Burleigh has in his
veins the blood of Bruce;—which, after all, is not so
honest or so legitimately royal as that of Baliol.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>TITLES UNDER ATTAINDER.</i></div>

<p>With regard to Jacobite peerages, ‘Experience has
shown that in the absence of a Resolution and Judgment
of the House of Lords, it is a dangerous thing to
say, without qualification, who represents a Peerage.
The Duchess of Sutherland is Countess of Cromartie,
as the Earl of Errol is Baron Kilmarnock, not in the
Peerage of Scotland, but that of the United Kingdom,
in virtue of a recent creation. Each of the <em>Scottish</em>
Peerages held by the three Jacobite Noblemen is still
open to any Nobleman who can establish a right thereto,
and obtain a reversal of the Attainder.’ (‘Notes and
Queries,’ <abbr title="January">Jan.</abbr> 11, 1873, p. 45.) As to the heir to the
title of Balmerino, we find that Captain John Elphinstone,
R.N. (Admiral Elphinstone of the Russian Navy,—the
hero of Tchesme), left a son, William, also a
captain in the Czar’s navy, whose son, Alexander
Francis, Captain R.N., and a noble of Livonia (born
1799), claimed to be heir to the title of Balmerino,
were the attainder removed. All his sons were in the
British naval or military service, in which they and
other members of the baronial house greatly distinguished
themselves.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>FITZ-PRETENDERS.</i></div>

<p>While some of the above titles were being relieved
from the obloquy which had been brought upon them by
the Jacobitism of former wearers, and no one was dreaming,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span>
except in some out-of-the-way corner of the Scottish
highlands, that the Jacobites had still, and had never
ceased to have, a king of their own, a strange, wild,
story was developing itself, which had a remarkably
ridiculous, not to say impudent, object for its motive.
To make it understandable, the reader is asked to go a
few years back, in order to comprehend a mystery, in
which the ‘Quarterly Review’ of June, 1847, in an
article sometimes attributed to the Rt. Hon. John
Wilson Croker, but more correctly to Mr. Lockhart,
smashed all that was mysterious.</p>

<p>In the year 1800 (October 2nd), Admiral John Carter
Allen (or Allan), Admiral of the White, died at his house
in Devonshire Place, London. Such is the record in
the ‘Gentleman’s Magazine.’ In the succeeding number,
a correspondent describes him as an old Westminster
scholar, a brave sailor, a Whig well looked upon
by the Rockingham party, and of such good blood as
to induce Lord Hillsborough to believe that he was the
legal male heir to the earldom of Errol.</p>

<p>The admiral was twice married and had two sons.
By his will, dated February, 1800, he bequeathed to
the elder, ‘Captain John Allen, of His Majesty’s navy,’
2,200<abbr title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr>; to the younger, ‘Thomas Allen, third Lieutenant
in His Majesty’s navy,’ 100<abbr title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr> The reader is
respectfully requested to keep this lieutenant, Thomas
Allen, alone in view. He may turn out to be a very
unexpected personage.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ADMIRAL ALLEN’S SON AND GRANDSONS.</i></div>

<p>Lieutenant Thomas, in 1792, married, at Godalming,
Katherine Manning, the second daughter of the vicar.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span>
This would seem to have been a suitable marriage; but
it has been suggested that it may have appeared unsuitable
in the eyes of the admiral, and that, for this
reason, he bequeathed his younger son only 100<abbr title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr> But
whatever the reason for such disproportion may have
been, the lieutenant’s marriage produced two sons,
John Hay Allen and Charles Stuart Allen. The
younger gentleman married, in November, 1822, in
London, Anne, daughter of the late John Beresford,
Esq., M.P. In the record of this marriage, the bridegroom
is styled ‘youngest son of Thomas Hay Allen.’
In the same year, the lieutenant’s elder son published
a volume of poems (Hookham), which, however, excited
no attention, though it contained dark allusions to some
romantic history. The father, Thomas, the lieutenant,
seems to have been much on and about the Western
isles of Scotland, as well as on the mainland. There
existed there a fond superstition that Charles Edward
would appear in some representative of his race, very
near akin to himself. The lieutenant must have been
an impressionable man. He died about the year 1831,
and he must have revealed previously a secret to his
sons, who, in such case, kept it long under consideration,
till, probably out of filial respect for his veracity, they
manifested their belief in the revelation, and, in 1847,
declared themselves to be, the elder, John Sobieski
Stolberg Stuart; the younger, Charles Edward Stuart.
Their father, Lieutenant Thomas Allen, son of the old
Admiral of the White, must have imparted to them the
not uninteresting circumstance, that he was the legitimate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span>
son of the young Chevalier, and that all faithful
Scots and Jacobites <em>had yet a king</em>. Long after the
lieutenant’s death, a book was published in London
(1847), by Dolman, the Roman Catholic publisher, of
Bond Street, of which the two brothers were joint
authors, in which the words <em>you have yet a king</em>,
implied that John Sobieski S. Stuart was the individual
who had sole right to wear the crown of his
ancestors. But this momentous book was preceded by
others.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>WORKING THROUGH LITERATURE.</i></div>

<p>Mr. John Hay Allen, as before stated, first appeared
in literature in 1822. His volume of poems bore those
names. Twenty years later, in 1842, the same gentleman
edited, under the assumed name of John Sobieski
Stolberg Stuart, the ‘Vestiarium Scoticum,’ the transcript
from a MS. alleged to have been formerly in the
Scots College at Douay; with a learned introduction
and illustrative notes. This folio, at the time, made no
particular sensation. It was followed, in 1845, by a
work, in which the elder brother was assisted by the
younger, namely, ‘Costume and History of the Clans,’
with three dozen lithographs, in imperial folio; the
cheapest edition was priced at six guineas. Some were
much dearer. Two years later, a work very different
in intention, was published by the Roman Catholic
publisher Dolman, of Bond Street, who had Blackwood
of Edinburgh and London as his colleague. The title
of this book was ‘Tales of the Last Century, or Sketches
of the Romance of History between the years 1746 and
1846,’ by John Sobieski and Charles Edward Stuart.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span>
There is a dedication ‘To Marie Stuart, by her father
and uncle.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE ROMANCE OF THE STORY.</i></div>

<p>As Sketches of the <em>Romance</em> of History, the writers
<em>might</em> have meant that they were not dealing with
<em>reality</em>. But such seemingly was not their meaning.
They made a serious step towards asserting that the
elder brother was rightful heir to the throne of the
Stuarts; and that if Jacobites and Ultramontanists
should ever be in search of such an heir, after upsetting
the present ‘happy establishment,’ he was to be found
at his lodgings, prepared to wear the crown, with Jacobite
instincts and Ultramontane ferocity. Of course,
this was not said in words. It is rather implied in the
three sketches which make up the romance of ‘Tales of
the Last Century.’</p>

<p>The Tales illustrate the claims of the Chevalier John
Sobieski Stuart, after this fashion.—The ‘young Pretender’
married in 1772, Louise, Princess of Stolberg Gœdern,
and grand-daughter of the Jacobite Earl of Aylesbury,
who after his liberation from the Tower, in 1688,
for his political principles, settled in Brussels, and there
married (his second wife) a lady of the ancient family
of Argentain. The daughter and only child of this
marriage wedded with the Prince of Horne. Louisa of
Stolberg, the youngest child of the last named union,
married Charles Edward in 1772, when she was not yet
twenty, and he was fifty-two. According to the ‘Tales
of the Last Century,’ Louisa became the mother of a
son, in 1773. The alleged event was kept a profound
secret, and the child was as secretly carried on board<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span>
an <em>English man of war</em>! commanded by Commodore
O’Halleran, who, if he had his rights, was not only
foster-father to the mysterious infant, but also Earl of
Strathgowrie! Admiral Allen, it will be remembered,
was thought to be heir to the earldom of Errol.</p>

<div class="sidenote">‘<i>RED EAGLE.</i>’</div>

<p>It may here be observed, by way of recovering
breath, that if there ever had been a son of this
luckless couple, the fact would have been proudly
trumpeted to the world. The event the most eagerly
desired by the Jacobites was the birth of an heir to the
Stuarts. Had such an heir been born, to conceal the
fact from the adherents of the House of Stuart would
have been an act of stark madness. Such insanity
would have simply authorised the House of Hanover
to repudiate the claimant, if he ever should assume
that character.—To return to the romance of <span class="lock">history:—</span></p>

<p>The infant prince received by the commodore was
brought up by him as his own son. The young
adventurer was trained to the sea, and he cruised
among the western isles of Scotland. He appears in
the romance as the <em>Red Eagle</em>; by those who know him
he is treated with ‘Your Highness’ and ‘My Lord;’
and, like Lieut. Thomas Allen himself, he contracts a
marriage with a lady, which is reckoned as a misalliance
by those who are acquainted with his real
history. He drops mysterious hints that the Stuart
line is not so near extinction as it was generally
thought to be. The better to carry the race on, the
Red Eagle left, in 1831, two sons, the Chevaliers John
and Charles Stuart, the former being also known as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">395</span>
the Comte d’Albanie; and both, no doubt, sincerely
believing in the rigmarole story of Lieut. Thomas
Allen, <i lang="la">alias</i> Red Eagle, <i lang="la">alias</i> legitimate son of Charles
Edward, the young Chevalier!</p>

<div class="sidenote">‘<i>TALES OF THE LAST CENTURY.</i>’</div>

<p>The ‘Tales of the Last Century’ do not say this in
as many words. The book leaves a good deal to the
imagination. The hero fades out of the romance something
like Hiawatha, sailing into the mist after the
setting sun. There is abundance of melodramatic
business and properties throughout. There is mysterious
scenery, appropriate music, serious and comic
actors, complex machinery, ships of war sailing over
impossible waters and looking as spectral as Vanderdecken’s
ghastly vessel,—with booming of guns, harmonised
voices of choristers, cheers of <em>supers</em>, and
numerous other attractions in a dramatic way. There
is nothing ‘dangerous’ in the book, though one gentleman
does venture on the following Jacobite outburst:—‘Oh!
if I had lived when you did—or <em>yet</em>, if he who
is gone should rise again from the marble of St.
Peter’s,—I am a Highlander and my father’s son,—I
would have no king but Tearlach Righ nan Gael,’—no
other king but Charlie.</p>

<p>In another page, one of the actors puts a sensible
query, and adds a silly remark on the present condition
of the Stuart cause:—‘Wonderful!—but why
such mystery?—why?—for what should the birth of
an heir to the House of Stuart be thus concealed? It
had—it yet has friends (in Europe), and its interests
must ever be identified with those of France, Spain,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">396</span>
and Rome.’ Of this sort of thing, though there be
little, there is more than enough; but the reader,
as he proceeds, has an opportunity of conceiving a high
opinion of Red Eagle’s common sense, and of fully
agreeing with him at least in one observation which is
put in the following form: ‘Woman!’ said the Tolair,
‘this is no time for bombast and juggling!’ The old
Admiral Carter Allen never indulged in either. In his
will the gallant sailor calls John and Thomas Allen his
<em>sons</em>. He does not call Thomas his <em>foster</em> son. Prince
Charles Edward spoke of no child in <em>his</em> will but his
illegitimate daughter, the Duchess of Albany. The
Cardinal of York took the nominal title of king at his
brother’s death; and received the duchess into his
house. At her death, in 1789, the Crown jewels,
which James <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> had carried off from England, came
into the cardinal’s possession; and these, at the beginning
of the present century, he generously surrendered
to George <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> The cardinal was well assured that no
legitimate heir of his brother had ever existed.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE LEVER OF POETRY.</i></div>

<p>The assurance that there was one, however, continued
to be made, and that the sons of Tolair were as
poetical as they were princely was next asserted.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>POETICAL POLITICS.</i></div>

<p>In 1848, Mr. Dolman, of London (conjointly with
Blackwood), published a poetical manifestation by the
Count, John Sobieski Stuart, and his brother, Charles
Edward. It had an innocent look, but a mysterious
purpose. Its title is, ‘Lays of the Deer Forest.’ The
Lays are dedicated to Louisa Sobieska Stuart, by her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">397</span>
father and uncle. The second volume, consisting of
‘Notes,’ is dedicated to a Charles Edward Stuart, by <em>his</em>
father and uncle. There is something of a poetical
fire in the Lays; and much interesting matter on deer-stalking
and other sporting subjects in the Notes. The
spirit is thoroughly anti-English; very ‘Papistical’ in
the odour of its heavily-charged atmosphere, but
betraying the combined silliness and ferocity which
distinguished the Stuarts themselves, in a hero-worship
for the most cruel enemies of England. For instance,
in the poem called ‘Blot of Chivalry,’ Charles Edward
Stuart, the author, deifies Napoleon, and, if there be
any meaning at all to be attached to the words, execrates
England. In the ‘Appeal of the Faithful,’ there
is a mysterious declaration that the writer, or the faithful
few, will not bow the head to Somebody, and there are
as mysterious references to things which might have
been, only that they happened to be otherwise.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE BLACK COCKADE.</i></div>

<p>There is a little more outspokenness in ‘The
Exile’s Farewell,’ which heartily curses the often-cursed
but singularly successful Saxon, and still more heartily
vituperates the sensible Scots who stuck to the Brunswick
family and the happy establishment. The writer
sarcastically describes Scotland, for the exasperation of
those judicious Scots, in the words:—‘The abject
realm, a Saxon province made! and the Stuart heaps
fire on the heads of Scottish Whigs by accusing them
of common-place venality, and charging them with
selling ‘Their mother’s glory for base Saxon gold!’ The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">398</span>
figure the nobles from Scotland made at the Court of
London in 1848, is thus smartly <span class="lock">sketched:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">While in the Saxon capital enthralled,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Eclipsed in lustre, though in senses palled,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The planet nobles, alien to their own,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Circle, dim satellites, the distant throne:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Saxons themselves in heart, use, tongue disguised,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their own despising, by the world despised,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While those for whom they yield their country’s pride,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their name, their nation, and their speech deride.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The above figures of speech are admissible in
poetry, but in truth and plain prose they are ‘palabras.’
The two authors are as crushingly severe on the
English cockade as on the anti-Jacobite Scottish nobles.
The cockade is shown to be altogether an imposture.
The words in which the demonstration is made have,
however, left her Majesty’s throne unshaken. ‘At
this moment, most persons imagine that black is’
(the colour of) ‘the English cockade, ignorant that it
was that of the Elector of Hanover, and only introduced
into England with George <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>, who bore it as a
vassal of the Empire; and it may be little flattering to
the <i lang="fr">amour-propre</i> of the British people to know that
the cockade which they wear as national is the badge
of a petty fief, the palatinate of a foreign empire.’
On this matter it is certain that the national withers
are unwrung. The black cockade won glory at Dettingen,
lost no honour at Fontenoy, and was worn by
gallant men whom ‘John Sobieski Stuart’ could not
overcome when his sword was (if report be true)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">399</span>
unsheathed against English, Irish, and Scots, on the
field of Waterloo.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE ALLENS IN EDINBURGH.</i></div>

<p>Let us now turn to a minor Jacobite episode.—A
correspondent of ‘Notes and Queries,’ M. H. R.
(August 1st, 1857, p. 95), refers to an account the
writer had from an informant, who was accustomed to
meet John and Charles Allen in Edinburgh society.
‘I find however that their claims to legitimate descent
from the Royal Stuarts were treated in such society
quite as a joke, though the claimants were fêted and
lionised, as might be expected in such a case, in
fashionable circles. They usually appeared in full
Highland costume, in Royal Tartan. The likeness to
the Stuart family, I am told, was striking, and may
have been without improving their claim a whit.’ The
writer then alludes to the number of young ladies
who, at Her Majesty’s accession, were thought to bear
a great resemblance to the Queen. But accidental
resemblance is worthless as proof of consanguinity.
‘If,’ the writer continues, ‘the two claimaints have no
better foundation to rest upon, their cause is but weak,
for it is obvious there may be likeness without legitimate
descent; and I fancy, if the real history is gone into,
<em>that</em> is the point to be decided here.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE SUCCESSION TO THE CROWN.</i></div>

<p>The writer goes on to traduce the character of the
wife of Charles Edward. It must, indeed, be allowed
that from the year 1778, when she was twenty-six
years of age, and she first became acquainted with
Alfieri, the lover with whom she lived from 1780, with
some intervals, till his death in 1803, her character<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">400</span>
was under a shade, and yet, in 1791, the Countess of
Albany was received at Court, in London, by so very
scrupulous a sovereign lady as Queen Charlotte. So
scrupulous was the queen, that her reception of the
widow of Charles Edward seemed to disperse the breath
of suspicion that rested on her. Another circumstance
in her favour is the fact of George <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> having settled
a pension upon her. The Countess of Albany died at
Montpellier plain Madame Fabre, in 1824, leaving all
she possessed to her husband, the historical painter. It
will be seen from the last-named date, that Queen
Victoria and the wife of Charles Edward were for a few
years contemporaries.</p>

<p>But the countess is out of the question in this
matter of John and Charles Allen. The correspondent
of ‘Notes and Queries’ has something more to the point
when he says:—‘The question is not of any importance
as a matter of state. The succession to the English
crown is secured by parliament, and is not affected by
a descent from the young Pretender; but as an historical
fact, it is desirable that the truth of the story,
apparently set afloat by the father of these two gentlemen,
should be settled at once and for ever.’ <em>That</em>
has been effectually settled in the 81st volume of the
‘Quarterly,’ so far as the development from Allen to
Allan, and this to Stuart, is made out, without leaving a
link unsevered in the chain of testimony.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A DERWENTWATER AT DILSTON.</i></div>

<p>In the year 1868, the Ministry and the Lords of the
Admiralty, and the Commissioners of Greenwich Hospital
estates, were amused rather than alarmed by a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">401</span>
claim made to the forfeited earldom of Derwentwater,
and also to the confiscated estates. A sort of action
was added to the latter claim, by taking possession of
a portion of them, in the North. The claimant is an
accomplished lady who has been long known by
sympathising northern friends as Amelia Matilda,
Countess of Derwentwater. She backed the assumption
of such title by installing herself in one of the
ruined chambers of the castle in ruins—Dilston. Her
servants roofed the apartment with canvas, covered the
bare earthen floor with carpeting, made the best
apologies they could for doors and windows, hung some
‘family portraits’ on the damp walls, spread a table with
relics, documents, &amp;c., relating to the Derwentwater
persons and property: they hoisted the Derwentwater
flag on the old tower, and then opened the place to
visitors who sympathised with the countess in the way
in which she supported her dignity and its attendant
rheumatism.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>DESCENT OF THE CLAIMANT.</i></div>

<p>The Lords of the Admiralty and the Commissioners
of Greenwich Hospital speedily bestirred themselves.
They sent their representatives from London with due
authority to eject the lady, if they could not persuade
her to leave. The countess received them with mingled
courtesy and outspoken defiance. Her manners seem
to have resembled her costume, which consisted of a
foreign military upper coat, with a sword by her
side, and a white satin bonnet on her head. She
appeared to be between fifty and sixty years of age,
but owned only to forty. The countess made a stout<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">402</span>
fight for it, and when she was compulsorily put out of
the castle, she pitched a camp and dwelt in a tent on
the adjacent highway. Her effects and family relics,
portraits, plate, &amp;c., were announced for sale, under a
sheriff’s seizure. The announcement attracted many
buyers from London, their motive being less Jacobitism
than curiosity-dealing. The liberality of personal
friends satisfied the sheriff’s claims, by their bidding,
and the ‘relics’ were removed to Newcastle for public
exhibition; admission, 1<abbr title="shilling"><i>s.</i></abbr> The countess now attired in
her Stuart tartan, with a shoulder-scarf of silk of the
same pattern, and with a black plume in her bonnet,
attended, as the local advertisements said, ‘between
two and four, to explain several of the curiosities.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>OBSTACLES IN PEDIGREES.</i></div>

<p>The question remains as to identity. The Lords of the
Admiralty in London, when those relics of the Jacobite
time came up to trouble them, naturally asked, but in
more profuse and much more legal language, ‘<em>Who
are you?</em>’ The reply was not satisfactory. There has
already been recorded in these pages, under the dates
1731 and 1732, the coming of John Radcliffe to
Poland Street, London, to consult Cheselden, and the
death and funeral of the great surgeon’s patient—sole
son of the beheaded earl. The present countess, if
understood rightly, denies that the above John, ‘Earl
of Derwentwater,’ died childless, as he undoubtedly did,
in 1732. She states that he married in 1740 a certain
Elizabeth Amelia Maria, Countess of Waldsteinwaters
(which is a sort of translation of Derwentwater); that
he lived till 1798, when he must have been within
hail of centenarianism, and that he was succeeded by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">403</span>
his two sons in order of age, the first, Earl John, the
second, Earl John James. The last-named coronetted
shadow is described as dying in 1833, leaving his only
child, the present Amelia Matilda, Countess of Derwentwater,
who took possession of Dilston Castle, &amp;c., under
the delusion that she had hereditary right to both land
and dignity. She accounts for John, the son of the
beheaded earl, by saying that he lived till 1798 in the
utmost secrecy, under fear of being murdered by the
British Government! As he really died in 1732, unmarried,
and that the Government knew very well that
he was carried from London to be buried in his
mother’s grave in Brussels, one may be allowed to
suspect that there is some mistake in the pedigree to
which the Countess Amelia pins her faith.</p>

<p>With regard to the descendants of the Earl of Derwentwater,
in a line not yet considered, Mr. H. T.
Riley (in ‘Notes and Queries,’ October 25th, 1856, p.
336), says: ‘I remember being pointed out, some time
since, a person who bears the family name and is
generally reputed to be a descendant, through an
illegitimate son, of the unfortunate Earl of Derwentwater.
I have little doubt there are several other persons
similarly connected with him, to be found in the
neighbourhood of North or South Shields.’ A lady correspondent,
‘Hermentrude,’ says (‘Notes and Queries,’
November 16th, 1861), ‘I have been applied to, through
a friend, to communicate some genealogical particulars
for their (living descendants of the Radcliffes) benefit,
which, I am sorry to say, I was not able to ascertain.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">404</span>
I do not know through what branch they descend, but
I was told they still entertain hopes of a reversion of
the attainder and restoration of the title.’</p>

<p>After this romance, the chief actor in another made
his quiet exit from the stage.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>JOHN SOBIESKI STUART.</i></div>

<p>In 1872, the most eminent personage of this latest
Jacobite time, disappeared from the scene. The tall,
gaunt, slightly bent figure of the gentleman, who once believed
himself to be plain John Allen, till his father imparted
to him a story that he, the sire, was the legitimate
son of Charles Edward, and that plain John Allen was
John Sobieski Stolberg Stuart, was missed from the Reading
Room of the British Museum. There he used to enter,
cloaked and spurred like an old warrior, with a sort of
haughty resignation. Yet there was an air about him which
seemed as a command to all spectators to look at him
well, and to acknowledge that the character he had
inherited from his father the lieutenant, who fancied he
was the rightful King of England, was patent in him,
as clearly as if he had been born in the purple. Some
few people, of those whose idiosyncracy it is to lend
ready faith to the romantic impossible, believed in the
genuineness of the character, and held the pretensions
it interpreted to be as well-founded as those of either of
‘the Pretenders.’ This Chevalier Stuart, or Comte
d’Albanie, mixed a flavour of the scholar with that of
the warrior. He and his brother sat together apart from
unprincely folk in the Reading Room. Books, papers,
documents, and all the paraphernalia of study and research
were scattered about them.
<span class="sni"><i>THE ELDER SON OF ‘RED EAGLE.’</i></span>
Quietly unobtrusive,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">405</span>
yet with a ‘keep your distance’ manner about them,
they were to be seen poring over volumes and manuscripts
as if in search of proofs of their vicinity to the
throne, and found gratification in the non-discovery of
anything to the contrary. Looking at the elder
gentleman who was often alone, the spectator could not
help wondering at the assiduous pertinacity of the
Chevalier’s labour. Nothing seemed to weary him,
not even the wearisome making of extracts, the result
of which has not been revealed. Perhaps it was the
vainly attempted refutation of the plain, logical, consequential,
irrefutable statements made in Volume 81 of
the ‘Quarterly,’ by Mr. Lockhart, who, courteously
cruel, smashed to atoms the fanciful idea which had
entered Lieutenant Allen’s brains, and from which
idea was evolved the perplexing conclusion that he,
the ex-lieutenant, was Tolair Deargh, the Red Eagle,
and by divine grace, obstructed by human obstinacy,
king of three realms! The elder son of the Red Eagle
was as familiar a figure in the streets of London as he
was in the Museum; and wayfarers who had no thought
as to his individuality, must have felt that the cloaked
and spurred personage was certainly a gentleman who
wore his three score years and ten with a worthiness
exacting respect. The same may be said of his sorrowing
surviving brother, ‘Le Comte d’Albanie’ (Charles
Edward), as his card proclaims him. In this ‘Chevalier,’
whose figure is well known to most Londoners, the
chivalrous spirit survives. The last record of him in
this character is in the year 1875, when he knocked down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">406</span>
Donald Alison for violently assaulting the Comte’s
landlady in a Pimlico lodging house!</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>STUART ALLIANCES.</i></div>

<p>A year previously, the Lady Alice Mary Emily Hay,
daughter of the 17th Earl of Errol, and therefore of the
blood of Kilmarnock, did Colonel the Count Edward
Stuart d’Albanie the honour to become his wife. The
Colonel is the son of ‘The Count d’Albanie.’</p>

<p>This marriage is thus chronicled in Lodge’s Peerage
(1877, p. 238), ‘Lady Alice Mary Emily (Hay) <i>b.</i> 6th
July, 1835, <i>m.</i> 1st May, 1874, Colonel the Count
Charles Edward d’Albanie, only son of Charles Edward
Stuart, Count d’Albanie, and Anne Beresford, daughter
of the Hon. John de la Poer Beresford, brother of the
1st Marquis of Waterford.’ Anne Beresford—widow
Gardiner,—is variously described as marrying, in 1822,
‘C. E. Stuart, Esq.,’ and ‘Charles Stuart Allen, younger
son of Thomas Hay Allen.’</p>

<p>The Colonel Count d’Albanie who married Lady
Alice Hay is said to have been in the service of Don
Carlos, than which nothing could so little recommend
him to a humane, right-thinking, liberal, peace-loving,
blood-odour-hating world. There is, however, manifestly,
some difficulty in identifying the descendants of
Lieutenant Thomas Allen, or Red Eagle, who mistook
himself for a never-existing son of the once ‘young
Chevalier.’ Perhaps the countship of Albany is not the
exclusive possession of Lieutenant Allen’s descendants.
It is at least certain that, a couple of years ago, there
was some talk in London of a Count and Countess
‘d’Albanie,’ in Hungary, but what their pretensions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">407</span>
were has gone out of memory; but they must, rightly
or wrongly, have had <em>some</em>, if the tale be true that
they quitted a small estate there, somewhat offended,
because the bishop of the diocese had refused to allow
them to sit in the sanctuary of some church, on purple
velvet chairs!</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>FULLER PARTICULARS.</i></div>

<p>In all this affair Lieutenant Thomas Allen may
deserve rather to be pitied than blamed. That he was
under a delusion seems undeniable. The immediate
victims of it, his sons, do not forfeit respect for crediting
a father’s assertions. They or their descendants must
not expect the world to have the same confidence in
them.</p>

<p>A clear and comprehensive view of this family
matter may be acquired by perusing the following
statement, which appeared in ‘Notes and Queries,’
July 28th, 1877, and which is from one who speaks
with knowledge and authority.</p>

<p>‘When James Stuart, Count d’Albanie, died, he
left two sons and one daughter.’</p>

<p>To understand this starting point aright, the reader
should remember that the above-named James Stuart
was originally known as Lieutenant Thomas Allen,
second son of Admiral Allen. The two sons and one
daughter are thus <span class="lock">enumerated:—</span></p>


<ul><li>‘1st. John Sobieski Stuart, Count d’Albanie,</li>
<li>2nd. Count Charles Edward d’Albanie.</li>
<li>3rd. Countess Catherine Matilda d’Albanie.’</li>
</ul>

<p>The first of the three was the author of poems
published in 1822, as written by John Hay Allen.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">408</span>
Both those gentlemen subsequently became authors of
works, under the name of Stuart.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE STUART-D’ALBANIES.</i></div>

<p>‘The elder son, John Sobieski, Count d’Albanie,
married the eldest surviving daughter of Edward
Kendall, of Osterey (<i lang="la">vide</i> Burke’s ‘Landed Gentry,’
under Kendall of Osterey), and died, leaving no
children.</p>

<p>‘The second son, Charles Edward Stuart, now
Count d’Albanie, married Anna Beresford, daughter
of the Hon. and Right Hon. John Beresford, second
son of Marcus Beresford, Earl of Tyrone, and brother
of the first Marquis of Waterford, and by her had four
children.</p>

<p>‘1st. Count Charles Edward d’Albanie, major in
the Austrian Cavalry, in which he served from 1840
to 1870, when he left the service and came to England,
and in 1874 married Lady Alice Mary Hay, sister of
the present and eighteenth Earl of Errol.</p>

<p>‘2nd. Countess Marie, who died at Beaumanoir on
the Loire, on the 22nd of August, 1873, and was
buried in the cemetery of St. Cyr sur Loire.</p>

<p>‘3rd. Countess Sobieska Stolberg, married Edouard
Platt de Platt, in the Austrian Imperial Body Guard, and
has one son, Alfred Edouard Charles.</p>

<p>‘4th. The Countess Clementina, a nun.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>JACOBITE LORD CAMPBELL.</i></div>

<p>‘The Countess Catherine Matilda, daughter of James
Count d’Albanie’ (that is, of the gentleman first known
as Admiral Allen’s son), ‘married Count Ferdinand de
Lancastro, by whom she had one son, Count Charles
Ferdinand Montesino de Lancastro <i lang="fr">et d’Albanie</i>, from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">409</span>
his mother. He also served in the Austrian army, in the
Kaiser Kürassier Regiment, or Imperial Cuirassiers, of
which the emperor is colonel. He volunteered, by permission
of the emperor, Franz Joseph, into the Lancers
of the Austrian Army Corps which accompanied the
Arch-Duke Maximilian to Mexico, and during the
three years’ campaign he received four decorations for
valour in the many actions at which he was present,
two of which were given to him by the Emperor
Maximilian, one being the Gold Cross and Eagle of
the Order of Ste. Marie de Guadalupe, and two by the
Emperor Napoleon <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>, and also four clasps. After the
campaign terminated, he returned to Austria with his
regiment, and got leave to visit his uncle, the present
Count d’Albanie, then in London, where he died on
the 28th September, 1873, from inflammation of the
lungs, at the age of twenty-nine years and five days.’
(Signed ‘R. I. P.’)</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>LORD CAMPBELL, ON OLD JUDGMENTS.</i></div>

<p>Some adherents to the cause of the Stuarts have
survived to the present reign, and one at least may
be found who was keeper of the sovereign’s conscience,
and sat on the woolsack. It is certainly somewhat
remarkable to find that one of Her Majesty’s chancellors
was not only a Jacobite at heart, like Johnson in part
of the Georgian Era, but openly expressed, that is,
printed and published, his opinions. In Lord Campbell’s
life of Lord Cowper, the lord chancellor who
presided at the trial of the rebel lords in 1716, the
biographer alludes to the new Riot Act brought in by
Cowper, in which it was stated that if as many, or as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">410</span>
few, as a dozen persons assembled together in the
streets, and did not disperse within an hour after a
magistrate’s order to that effect, the whole dozen would
incur the penalty of death, and might be lawfully
strangled at Tyburn. ‘This,’ says Lord Campbell,
‘was perhaps a harsher law than ever was proposed in
the time of the Stuarts,’ but he adds that it was not
abused in practice, yet, nevertheless, ‘it brought great
obloquy upon the new dynasty.’ Lord Cowper in
charging and in sentencing the rebel lords in 1716, and
Lord Hardwicke, in addressing and passing judgment
upon the rebel lords in 1746, could scarcely find terms
harsh enough to express the wickedness, barbarity, and
hellish character of the rebellion and of the lords who
were the leaders in it. As to their own disgust at such
unmatched infamy, like Fielding’s <cite>Noodle</cite>, they could
scarcely find words to grace their tale with sufficiently
decent horror. Lord Chancellor Campbell, in the reign
of Victoria, flames up into quite old-fashioned hearty
Jacobitism, and ‘bites his thumb’ at his two predecessors
of the reigns of the first two Georges. In especial
reference to the ultra severe strictures of the Chancellor
Hardwicke in 1746, the Jacobite chancellor in the
reign of Victoria says, in Hardwicke’s ‘Life,’ ‘He forgot
that although their attempt, not having prospered, was
called <em>treason</em>, and the law required that they should
be sentenced to death, they were not guilty of any
moral offence, and that if they had succeeded in
placing Charles Edward on the throne of his grandfather,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">411</span>
they would have been celebrated for their
loyalty in all succeeding ages.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>TIME’S CHANGES.</i></div>

<p>And now, in the year 1877, we are gravely told
that the claims of the brother, who supposes himself
to be a legitimate heir of the Stuarts (a supposition
as idle as the claim of the convict Orton to be a
baronet is infamous), have been fully investigated by a
‘delegation of Roman Catholic clergy, nobility, and
nobles of Scotland,’ who, it is added, with amusing
significance, pronounced those claims to be <em>valid</em>.’
We hear nothing, however, of the names of the
investigators, nor of the evidence on which their
judgment was founded. Awaiting the publication of
both, the investigation (if it ever took place) may be
called a <em>trait</em> of the very latest Jacobitism on record.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>AT CHELSEA AND BALMORAL.</i></div>

<p>After being a serious fact, Jacobitism became (with
the above exception) a sentiment which gradually died
out, or which was applied in quite an opposite sense to
that in which it originated. When the French revolution
showed a taste for pulling down everything that was
right on end, the old London Jacobite toast, ‘May
times mend, and down with the bloody Brunswickers!’
ceased to be heard. Later, too, the wearing of gilded
oak-apples, on the 29th of May, ceased to be a Jacobite
emblem of love for the Stuart race of kings. It was
taken as a sign that the wearer was glad that a king at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">412</span>
all was left to reign in England. It is only as yesterday
that in Preston unruly lads were called ‘a parcel of
young Jacobites,’—so strong and enduring was the
memory of the Jacobite presence there. <em>Now</em>, yearly
at Chelsea, the veteran soldiers are drawn up in
presence of the statue of Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>, on the anniversary
of his restoration. They perform an act of homage by
uncovering in that bronze presence (with its permanent
sardonic grin), and they add to it the incense of three
cheers in honour of that civil and religious king, and
his ever-welcome restoration. How different from the
time of the first George, when soldiers in the Guards
were lashed to death, or near to it, in the Park, for
mounting an oak leaf on the 29th of May, or giving a
cheer over their cups for a prince of the line of Stuart.
The significance of words and things has undergone a
happy change. Donald Cameron, of Lochiel, is groom-in-waiting
to the Queen; and, on Her Majesty’s last
birthday, at Balmoral, the singers saluted her awaking
with welcome Jacobite songs, and ended their vocalisation
with ‘Wha’ll be King but Charlie?’</p>
